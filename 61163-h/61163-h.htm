</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_77 c013'>IT was a very warm afternoon,
and Girlie was sitting by
the play-room window watching
the gold fish idly swimming
about in her little aquarium.
She was feeling very “sigh” as
she called it, that is, not very
happy, for her brothers were
all away from home, and she
had no one to talk to. Even
Boy, her youngest brother,
was staying with some friends at Broadstairs, and she
thought it very hard that she should have to wait at
home for another week before joining him there. Her aunt,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>with whom she was staying, had received a letter from
him that morning and had brought it up to Girlie to read.</p>
<p class='c014'>“But it will only make me more sorry than ever that
I am not there,” thought poor Girlie. She had the letter
in her hand and was trying to decide whether she should
read it or not when she caught sight of a few words at
the bottom of the first page, which was half drawn out
of the envelope:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c015'>was written in Boy’s big, sprawling handwriting.</p>
<p class='c014'>“Whatever is a Goo?” thought Girlie; and, instead of
reading the rest of the letter as most people would have
done, she shut her eyes and tried to think whether she
had ever heard of, or seen such a thing. She was trying
hard to remember whether there was such a creature
mentioned in her Natural History book, and had just come
to the conclusion that she had never read of one, when
she heard a little cough from the other end of the room,
and, opening her eyes, she saw Dumpsey Deazil, her
favourite doll, struggling up from the very uncomfortable
position in which she had been lying, with her head in a
domino box and her feet on Noah’s Ark.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
<img src='images/p009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>DUMPSEY DEAZIL.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Girlie stared with amazement, and the more so when
Dumpsey Deazil, having succeeded in getting on to her
feet, walked awkwardly up to where she was sitting, and
holding out a stiff, sawdust-stuffed hand, said in a squeaky
little voice:</p>

<p class='c014'>“So you want to know what a Goo is, do you?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/p010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘YOU DEAR OLD THING,’ CRIED GIRLIE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you dear old thing!” cried Girlie, jumping up
excitedly, and catching Dumpsey Deazil up in her arms.
“I always <i>knew</i> that you could talk if you only <i>would</i>, and
now at last you are going to do so, just as dolls always
do in fairy tale books.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>“Of course <i>all</i> dolls can talk if they like,” said Dumpsey
Deazil; “only they never do so, except when they wish.
But about the Goo, do you really want to know what
it is?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I do,” said Girlie, “because I don’t remember
ever having heard of such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I don’t quite know what it is myself,” said
Dumpsey Deazil, “but I can take you to the land of
Why if you like, where all the questions and answers come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>from, and then you can find out for yourself, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! that would be splendid!” exclaimed Girlie. “Is
it a very long way off though?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it is rather a long way,” admitted Dumpsey Deazil;
“but it would not take us long to get there by the way in
which we should go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How is that?” asked Girlie. “By train?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear, no!” cried Dumpsey Deazil; “by a <i>much</i>
quicker way than that. You have just to take hold of one
of my hands and, shutting your eyes very tightly, count up
to one hundred aloud, and then when you open them again
you will find yourself there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What a funny way to travel,” said Girlie. “I am
sure, though, that I should like it very much indeed. Can
we go now, this very minute?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Dumpsey Deazil; “but, before we start, you
must promise me that you will be very kind to the
Wallypug, for he is a kind of relation of mine.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Wallypug! Good gracious! Whoever is he?”
exclaimed Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You will see when you get to Why,” said Dumpsey
Deazil mysteriously. “Now then, are you ready? Remember,
though, you must <i>be sure</i> and not let go of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>hand till you have counted up to one hundred, or you
will lose me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right!” promised Girlie, taking hold of Dumpsey
Deazil’s hand and screwing up her eyes very tightly.
“One, two——”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was sorely tempted to open her eyes, however, when
she felt herself being carried off her feet; still, she felt
very comfortable and it seemed to her that she was floating
rapidly through the air.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c014'>“Eighty-five, eighty-six! Oh dear! somebody has taken
hold of my other hand now,” cried Girlie. “I really
<i>must</i> look.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And, opening her eyes, she found herself in a country
lane.</p>

<p class='c014'>A benevolent-looking little old gentleman, dressed in
knee breeches and wearing a huge broad-brimmed hat,
was holding her wrist with one hand, while in the other
he held a toy watch.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dumpsey Deazil was floating rapidly away in the distance,
frantically waving her arms and screaming out in
an agonised voice,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“I told you not to open your eyes until you had got
to one hundred!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
<img src='images/p013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“DUMPSEY DEAZIL WAS FLOATING RAPIDLY AWAY.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Girlie watched her disappear over the hedge, and then
turned in dismay to the little old gentleman, who was
still holding her hand and beaming upon her with a reassuring
smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Your friend was taking you through the air rather
too quickly to be good for your health, so I thought that I
had better stop you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, then, I think it was very rude of you,” said
Girlie, who felt greatly alarmed at having lost Dumpsey
Deazil. “I don’t know, I am sure, however I am going to
get home again now,” she continued, feeling half inclined
to cry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Excuse me, you should never say ‘<i>I don’t know</i>,’” said
the old gentleman. “It is a very bad plan. If you
really do not know anything, you should always pretend
that you do. I invariably do so, and I ought to know,
for I am the Wallypug’s Doctor-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! Who <i>is</i> the Wallypug, please?” asked Girlie
curiously, “and I’m afraid I don’t know what a doctor-in-law
is, either.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“One question at a time, my child,” said the old gentleman.
“Who the Wallypug is you will soon find out
for yourself; and a doctor-in-law is something between
a father-in-law and a step-father, a sort of half-a-stepfather,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>in fact. That will be six-and-eightpence, please,”
and the Doctor-in-law held out his hand with a smile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What for?” exclaimed Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Professional advice,” said the Doctor-in-law blandly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What advice?” asked Girlie; “I don’t know what you
mean.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Didn’t I <i>advise</i> you never to say, ‘I don’t know’?”
explained the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I didn’t ask you to give me any advice at all,”
cried Girlie in dismay.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! if I waited till people <i>asked</i> me for advice I
should never get any clients!” said the Doctor-in-law;
“and you might as well give me the other guinea at the
same time,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What other guinea? What <i>do</i> you mean?” asked
Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The guinea for professional attendance when you first
arrived here,” said the Doctor-in-law. “I always charge
a guinea for that.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I didn’t want you to attend to me,” said Girlie
indignantly. “I wish you hadn’t.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If I waited till people <i>wanted</i> me to attend to them
I should get no patients,” admitted the Doctor-in-law; “so
I always attend to people when I think they require it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>whether they wish me to do so, or not. I must really
insist on the fee, please. Let’s see, that will be three
pounds seven altogether, won’t it?” he continued, making
a calculation in his pocket-book.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly not!” said Girlie; “how can you make that
out?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, you see, if you add them together they come
to about that,” said the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am sure they don’t,” cried Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s very rude to contradict your elders,” remarked
the Doctor-in-law severely. “I am surprised at you.
Give me the money at once, please.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I have no money with me,” said Girlie, getting
rather frightened.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear me, this is very serious,” said the old gentleman,
looking genuinely grieved. “Do you really mean to
tell me,” he continued, “that you are travelling about
the country without any money at all in your pocket?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Girlie. “You see, I didn’t know that I
was coming here, or that I should require any.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! that’s an absurd excuse, my dear,” said the
Doctor-in-law. “But what’s that in your hand?” he continued,
staring at her right hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie opened it, and found a crumpled piece of paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in it, though how it came there she could never tell.
Smoothing it out, she found it to be a kind of money-order
with the words, “Please to pay the bearer the sum
of five pounds. Signed, <span class='sc'>The Wallypug</span>,” written on it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! a Wallypug order for five pounds; that will do
very nicely,” said the Doctor-in-law, taking it from her
and putting it into his pocket. “And now you will only
owe me the odd sixpence,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What odd sixpence?” asked Girlie. “I don’t remember
anything about a sixpence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” said the Doctor-in-law, “if you don’t remember
it, <i>it’s very odd</i>, therefore it must be an odd sixpence; don’t
you see, my dear?” and he held out his hand again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I’ve already given you five pounds instead of three
pounds seven,” said Girlie, getting hopelessly muddled.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, my dear, don’t let <i>that</i> worry you in the least,”
said the Doctor-in-law kindly; “I’ll overlook it this time,
and, if you can’t find the sixpence, I don’t mind taking
your watch instead. I see that you have a very pretty one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think it’s very unkind and greedy of you, then!”
said Girlie, turning very red and feeling greatly frightened;
for her watch had been given to her by her aunt, and she
was allowed to wear it only now and then as a great treat.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not at all, my dear; you don’t look at these things in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>the right light,” said the Doctor-in-law. “Don’t you see
that, if you can’t pay me the money, it is only fair that
you should give me your watch?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But it is worth a great deal more than sixpence,”
argued Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not at all!” said the Doctor-in-law, flourishing his
watch about at the end of the chain. “Mine only cost
a penny.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, but yours doesn’t go,” objected Girlie; “mine
does, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Does what?” asked the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go!” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, well, then, I don’t want it,” said the Doctor-in-law
hurriedly. “I don’t want a watch that will <i>go</i>, I want
one that will stay. Why, if my watch was to <i>go</i>, I should
always have to be going after it! and, talking about going,
I must be off or I shall be late for the Wallypug. You
can pay me the half-crown when we meet again.” And,
with a nod and a smile, the little old gentleman pocketed
his watch and hurried off.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! if you please!” cried Girlie, running after him,
“could you direct me to——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can’t stop!” interrupted the Doctor-in-law; “my time
is far too valuable, and besides, you have no money.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>And walking rapidly away, he got over a stile and
disappeared into a field beyond.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear me! whatever <i>shall</i> I do now?” thought poor
Girlie, looking about her in dismay.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was nobody in sight, so she decided to sit down
on the bank and wait until some one came past who would
direct her to somewhere or other.</p>

<p class='c014'>“For I haven’t the remotest idea where I am,” she
thought. “I don’t even know how many miles I am
from home. I wonder,” she went on, “how many miles
one can travel through the air while you count eighty-five.
I suppose it depends upon how quickly you are
travelling. Perhaps I could make a sum of it and do
it by rule of three. Let’s see! If it takes one girl one
minute to count sixty, how many miles can a girl and
a doll travel through the air while you count eighty-five?
I suppose you have to multiply the minutes by the miles,
and divide by the number of people,” she thought; and
was so very busy trying to <i>do this sum in her head</i>, as
she described it, that she did not notice a young man
walking down the lane, till he had nearly reached her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie could scarcely keep from laughing when she first
saw him, for he looked such a <i>very</i> comical person; he
had long hair, and wore glasses, and carried his hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>dangling in front of him. (“For all the world like a
kangaroo,” thought Girlie.)</p>

<p class='c014'>He came and sat down quite close to her, and after
staring at her for some time, smiled in a patronising kind
of way.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p020.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“HE LOOKED SUCH A VERY COMICAL PERSON.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t you think me very handsome?” he said at
last.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I am afraid not,” stammered Girlie, who did
not like to hurt his feelings by telling him what she
really did think about him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear me! then your eyes must be seen to, decidedly,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>said the young man. “Why, you must be nearly blind
not to see that I am very, <i>very</i> beautiful; and I am a very
<i>important</i> person, too,” he continued impressively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you really?” asked Girlie, who could scarcely
keep serious.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I am a very superior individual indeed. I am
the King’s Minstrel, enormously rich, and I am going to
marry the Wallypug’s niece. I <i>compose</i> better than any one
else in the world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Really!” said Girlie. “What do you compose?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Draughts,” said the King’s Minstrel. “Of course you
have heard of composing draughts.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Girlie. “They are things to send you
to sleep, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sometimes,” said the King’s Minstrel. “Mine keep
you awake, though, and that’s why they are so much
better than anybody else’s.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t it very difficult to compose?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes; it requires a great brain like mine to do it
properly,” replied the King’s Minstrel conceitedly.
“Would you like to hear my latest composition?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, please,” said Girlie, folding her hands in her lap
and preparing to listen.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The King’s Minstrel took a roll of music from under
his arm and, after coughing importantly, began to sing in
a very harsh and discordant voice—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Won’t you walk into my parlour?’ said the spider to the fly,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How I wonder what you are, up above the world so high.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘I’m going a-milking, sir,’ she said,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And when she got there the poor dog was dead.</div>

      <div class='line'>“Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>And if I don’t hurt her she’ll do me no harm.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“There! isn’t it lovely?” he asked when he had
finished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, it’s perfect <i>nonsense</i>!” cried Girlie; “it’s just
a lot of separate lines from nursery rhymes all strung
together; and, besides, there’s no sense in it,” she added.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That shows you don’t know anything at all about it,”
said the King’s Minstrel contemptuously. “Any respectable
person knows that there never <i>should</i> be any sense in
really good poetry; the less you are able to understand
it the better it is; and it wouldn’t be a composition,” he
went on, “if it wasn’t <i>composed</i> of several bits of other
poems. The great thing is to get it to rhyme. You see
this all rhymes beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“I’m sure the last two lines don’t!” said Girlie
decidedly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh!” said the King’s Minstrel, looking rather confused,
“you see, you have to pronounce ‘<i>harm</i>’ as near like
‘<i>wall</i>’ as you can; you often have to do that in poetry,
you know. Besides, people always pardon little slips
of that kind in really clever people, like myself. Good-bye!
You <i>may</i> have the honour of meeting me again
later,” he continued, preparing to go.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I was going to ask you,” cried Girlie hurriedly,
“whether you could kindly direct me to Why, or tell me
the way to get home again.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I beg your pardon, but I make it a point <i>never</i> to do
anything useful. I am purely <i>ornamental</i>,” said the King’s
Minstrel, bowing politely and then strutting away with
a conceited air, leaving Girlie once more alone in the
lane.</p>

<img src='images/p024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_77 c013'>“WELL, which way shall I
go?” said Girlie to herself
looking up and down the
lane, “for it will never do to
stay here all day, you know.
I wish I had a compass,”
she continued, “I should
know which way to go,
then.”</p>
<p class='c014'>Girlie had the haziest
notions as to what a compass
really is, but had
come to the conclusion
that you had only to look
at one in order to find your way anywhere.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose,” she continued, “I had better follow the
lane; it’s sure to lead to somewhere or other.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>She could see that a little further on the roadway took
a sudden turn to the left, and, on reaching the corner, she
found herself facing a large pond, by the side of which
a fish, well wrapped up in a plaid shawl, was sitting on a
wooden stool fishing.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the other side of the road was a five-barred gate,
on which sat a calf dressed in a bright blue coat, yellow-striped
waistcoat, and red plush knee-breeches; he wore
his hat quite at the back of his head, because of his horns,
and had a scarlet geranium in his coat; he was tapping
his hoof impatiently with a small cane which he carried
in one <i>hand</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here she comes at last,” he called out to the Fish when
Girlie came in sight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“O-o-o-b! o-o-o-b! o-o-o-b!” said the Fish, rolling his
great eyes around and staring dejectedly at her, and then
immediately resuming his occupation.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What does he say?” asked Girlie, who, somehow or
other, did not feel at all surprised at this strange sight;
perhaps it was because she had read so many fairy tales.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing,” said the Calf, “he never talks when he is
fishing; it isn’t considered polite; he says ‘o-o-o-b’
because he can’t help it; <i>all</i> fishes say that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And, when Girlie came to think of it, she remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that her gold fish at home always seemed to be saying
“o-o-o-b, o-o-o-b,” when she looked at them swimming
about.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what is he fishing for?” she asked. “I have
never heard of a fish fishing before.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘WHAT IS HE FISHING FOR?’ SHE ASKED.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Why shouldn’t a fish fish, as well as a baker bake,
or a tailor tail?” asked the Calf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I’ve never heard of tailors tailing before,” said
Girlie. “Do they?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly they do,” said the Calf; “they <i>retail</i> and
<i>coat tail</i>, don’t they?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes, of course,” admitted Girlie; “but what does
he fish for?” she persisted, pointing to the fish.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Compliments,” said the Calf abruptly.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Oh, I’ve heard of people fishing for compliments
before,” thought Girlie. “Has he caught anything?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said the Calf, grinning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What?” asked Girlie eagerly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Same as most folks do that go fishing—a cold,” replied
the Calf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear! where did he catch it?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In his head, to be sure,” said the Calf; “he is very
subject to them; I think it’s being in the water so much,”
he continued; “he gets <i>frightfully</i> damp sometimes when
he’s been swimming about all day. It’s a great pity, too,
for he is going to lecture at Why this afternoon before
the Wallypug on the ‘<i>Whichness of the What, as compared
to the Thatness of the Thus</i>.’ Shall you be there?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know,” said Girlie dubiously; “I want to go to
Why, though,” she said. “Can you direct me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes!” replied the Calf. “Do you know anybody
there?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie, thinking that Dumpsey Deazil must have gone
there, nodded her head.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, don’t do <i>that</i>,” cried the Calf in a tone of alarm,
while the Fish turned slowly round and stared at her again.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“What did I do?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You <i>nodded your head</i>; it’s a very dangerous thing
to do; you might turn into a <i>Mandarin</i>,” said the
Calf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is that?” asked Girlie, who couldn’t remember
having heard the name before, though it seemed familiar
too.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Any one who cannot say ‘<i>no</i>’ is a Mandarin,” said the
Calf; “the worst kind are the Chinese, who are born with
a wire through their necks, so that they can only move
their heads in one direction.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I know! You mean little figures that nod their
heads when you touch them,” cried Girlie. “I remember
now, I saw one in a toyshop the other day. They are
made of china, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course,” said the Calf, “<i>all</i> the Chinese are made
of china, just as all the Japanese are japanned. There is a
song about a Mandarin that ought to be a warning to
people not to nod their heads. Shall I repeat it?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes, please,” replied Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“O-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, stop a biddit,” said the Fish,
putting away his fishing-rod and wobbling awkwardly
towards them. “Led be hear id, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Oh, you’ve heard it before,” said the Calf; “get on
with your fishing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“O-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, I’ve odely heard id dide
tibes,” said the Fish pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then, come and sit down,” said the Calf,
pointing to where Girlie had settled herself on a little
mound beside the road.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fish sat down, and, opening his mouth very widely,
stared vacantly at the Calf, who repeated the following
lines:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Girlie was just wondering whether she ought to clap
her hands, when the Fish, who had been sitting all the
while with his mouth wide open, rolled his eyes ecstatically
and exclaimed in a gratified way—“O-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, o-o-o-b,
thad’s very, very comfordig.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you mean?” asked Girlie.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id010'>
<img src='images/p032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“SHE FELT HERSELF PUSHED ‘SPLASH’ INTO THE POND.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“O-o-o-b. Well, you see, I couldn’t dod by head if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>I tried,” said the Fish, “so I cad dever get into the sabe
buddle thad the baderid did. Besides——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I say,” interrupted the Calf, and speaking to Girlie,
“hadn’t you better be off if you are going? or you won’t
get to Why to-day, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie had been so interested in hearing about the
Mandarin, that she had forgotten all about wanting to
go there.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shall you go by water?” continued the Calf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is that the quickest way?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it is,” said the Calf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I think I will,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well,” replied the Calf, “step in.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“In where?” asked Girlie, puzzled to know what he
meant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Into the <i>water</i>, of course,” said the Calf. “You said
you were going by water, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I shall get wet,” cried Girlie in alarm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no, you won’t; this is <i>dry</i> water,” said the
Calf.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How absurd!” said Girlie; “why, I’ve never heard of
such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, you haven’t heard of much, then,” said the Calf.
“I suppose you haven’t even heard of <i>dry</i> champagne?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Oh yes, I have,” said Girlie, “and often wondered
what it meant.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then, this is <i>dry water</i>; it’s the same sort
of thing,” said the Calf. “Step in, and you will see; you
needn’t be afraid; make haste.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After a little hesitation, Girlie walked to the edge of the
water, and, before she could realise what had happened,
she felt herself pushed “splash” into the pond by the
Fish, who had followed closely behind her. Strangely
enough, she did not feel frightened, but only very indignant,
when she found herself sinking rapidly through the water.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear me! I wonder how long I shall be reaching the
bottom,” she thought: “it seems to be getting very dark,
so I suppose that I must be a good way down by this
time.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She hadn’t time to speculate much longer, however, for
she suddenly found herself stopping before a barrier at
an underground station. A ticket porter was holding out
his hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tickets, please,” he shouted in a loud voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m very sorry, but I haven’t one,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Defrauding the Company, infringement of by-laws.
Penalty, forty pounds!” said the Porter severely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear!” said Girlie, feeling really alarmed, “I didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>know that I had to take a ticket.” And, when she came
to think of it, she didn’t see how she <i>could</i> have done so.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What class did you travel?” asked the Porter suddenly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know,” said Girlie, feeling dreadfully puzzled;
“I don’t think that it was any class at all; besides, it
was so dark that I couldn’t see.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! that’s all very fine,” said the Porter, “but——”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘GO IN DIRECTLY AND FINISH SCRUBBING THE FLOOR.’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>What he meant to say Girlie never knew, for, at that
moment, a very stout, cross-looking woman, came through
a door at the side of the barrier, and called out in a
harsh voice to the Porter:</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dawdling away your time again, are you? leaving
me as usual to do all the work; go in directly and finish
scrubbing the floor;” and, catching hold of the poor
Porter’s coat collar, she pushed him roughly through the
door, slamming it violently after him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now, then, what do <i>you</i> want?” she exclaimed, turning
round furiously to Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! if you please——” began Girlie nervously, feeling
very much alarmed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, then, I don’t, please,” said the woman, snapping
her up before she could finish the sentence; “and if you’re
not off this very minute, you’ll catch it, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie did not wait to be told a second time, but, running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>as quickly as she could along the platform, she hastened
up the stairs at the other end. “Oh dear! oh dear!”
she panted while she hurried along, “I do hope that all
the people here are not so cross and disagreeable as that;
although I don’t know, I’m sure,” she thought, “<i>what</i> I
should have done about that ticket, if she hadn’t come
out and sent the Porter away;” and, finding to her great
relief that she was not being followed, Girlie hurried up
the stairs.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figleft id011'>
<img src='images/p038.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>WHEN she reached the top of the
stairs, Girlie found herself in a
courtyard, surrounded by high
railings and some massive iron
gates. There was a lodge by the gates, at the door of
which stood an old crocodile with a white bandage around
his head. He came slowly towards Girlie, carrying some
enormous keys in his hand.</p>
<p class='c014'>“Have you had your tea?” he queried anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No!” said Girlie, thinking that she should very much
like some after all those stairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then,” said the Crocodile, “we will have some
together; step this way.” Girlie followed him into the
lodge, the door of which opened directly into a cosy little
room. A table stood in the centre, covered with a white
table-cloth.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Will you have some eggs with your tea?” asked the
Crocodile kindly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, please,” replied Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And some cake and jam?” continued the Crocodile,
smilingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should like some very much indeed, thank you,” said
Girlie, who thought him very kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait a minute,” said the Crocodile; “I had better put
it down so that I don’t forget;” and he took down a slate
that was hanging behind the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s see,” he continued, writing it down, as he went
on, “thin bread-and-butter, eggs (boiled, I suppose?),” he
enquired, looking at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie was just going to nod her head, when she suddenly
remembered that, if she did so, she might turn into a
Mandarin; so she hastily said “Yes, please,” instead.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tea, cake, and jam,” continued the Crocodile, putting it
all down on his slate.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you sure you won’t have anything else?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no, thank you,” said Girlie, “that will do very
nicely.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“All right,” said the Crocodile; “where are the things?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What things?” asked Girlie in a surprised voice.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Why, the things for tea, of course,” said the Crocodile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I <i>haven’t</i> any,” said Girlie; “I thought that you
asked me to take tea with <i>you</i>,” she continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>The old Crocodile burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I think it most cru-cru-cruel of you,” he sobbed, “to
raise my ho-ho-ho-hopes in this way only to dis-dis-dis-ap-ap-ap-point
me. You said you were going to have eggs,” he
cried tearfully, referring to the slate, “and ca-ca-cake, and
ja-ja-jam;” and the poor old thing was quite overcome
with grief.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, <i>please</i> don’t cry,” said Girlie, who felt quite sorry for
him; “I am disappointed, too, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Crocodile dried his eye (the other one was covered
with the bandage) and began to brighten up a little.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know what we’ll do,” he said at length. “Do you ever
have tea for breakfast?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Girlie, “I don’t care for coffee.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then, let’s have <i>breakfast</i> for <i>tea</i> instead,”
suggested the Crocodile.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how can we do that if we haven’t the things?”
asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I have enough for <i>breakfast</i>,” said the Crocodile,
going to the cupboard and bringing out a basket of eggs, a
loaf of bread, some butter, a large iced cake and a pot of jam.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Why, they’re the same things that we were going to
have for tea,” thought Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s see, one for you, one for me, and one for the pot,”
remarked the Crocodile, putting three spoonfuls of tea into
the teapot. “You will find some hot water in the next
room,” he continued, handing it to Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie took the teapot and went to the door; she found
that it led into a large kitchen paved with red bricks. The
room was filled with steam and, at the further end of it,
Girlie could just see three large washtubs at which three
seals were washing table-cloths. They had coloured handkerchiefs
tied over their heads, and were singing when Girlie
entered. She could not hear all the words, but just caught
the end of the verse:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Most beautiful suds that e’er were seen,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of colours red, and blue, and green,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, tra-la-lee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>It finished on a very high note, which none of the seals
could reach, so that it ended in a kind of squeal.</p>
<p class='c014'>“What do you want?” asked the largest Seal, catching
sight of Girlie; “some hot water?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, please,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you going to have <i>tea</i> or <i>breakfast</i>?” asked the Seal
anxiously.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id012'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THEY WERE SINGING WHEN GIRLIE ENTERED.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Breakfast, I believe,” said Girlie, though she couldn’t at
all see why it should be called breakfast any more than tea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah! I was afraid so,” said the Seal in a disappointed
voice, while the other seals sighed heavily. “We haven’t
had tea here for weeks and weeks. How many spoonfuls
did he put in, dear?” he continued, taking the teapot from
her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Three,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One each,” said the Seal to the others, who nodded
their heads, then turning out the tea into a cup, he filled
the teapot with boiling water from a kettle on the fire,
and handed it back to Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aren’t you going to put the tea back again?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly not,” said the Seal; “that’s for us.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you know?” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because there were three spoonfuls and there are only
two of you, so it must be for us; now hurry back to the
Crocodile, or he will think you are lost,” said the Seal.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie took the teapot doubtfully, and went back to the
other room. She found that the Crocodile had set the table
while she had been gone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Will you pour out, please?” he said, seating himself,
and motioning Girlie to the head of the table. “Did you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>hear how he is to-day?” he continued in an anxious
tone when she had taken her place.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Who?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The <i>tea</i>,” said the Crocodile; “he has been very
poorly lately. Ah!” he continued, while Girlie poured
out the hot water, “poor little thing! poor little thing!
How dreadfully pale and weak he is, to be sure!” and,
taking the teacup from her, he gazed down into it
anxiously. “Do you think a little milk would do him
any good?” he asked at last.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t think it could possibly do any harm,” said
Girlie, who felt very much inclined to laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pass the milk-jug, then,” said the Crocodile.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie did so, and the Crocodile poured a little milk
into his cup.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gracious!” he cried, in an alarmed voice, after he
had done so. “It’s worse than ever; he is turning
paler than he was before. Pray run into the next room
and ask how the seals’ tea is getting on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie got up again and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Seals had left their washtubs, and were sitting
around the fire on little three-legged stools, eating rather
thick bread-and-butter; and the eldest Seal was just
pouring out tea.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“The Crocodile wishes to know how your tea is, if
you please,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! give him our compliments,” replied the Seal,
“and say that he is very well, thanks; getting quite
strong, and is learning to draw very nicely. How is
his poor tea, do you know, dear?” he added.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very weak,” said Girlie (“and likely to be so,” she
thought).</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mean to say you haven’t brought us any
cake?” said the youngest Seal.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said Girlie. “I didn’t know you wanted any.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, go and fetch some then, and bring your teacup
back with you,” said the Seal. “You shall have
some of our tea, if you like; it will be better for you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thought so, too, and ran back to the other room
to ask for some cake for the seals.</p>

<p class='c014'>She found the Crocodile with his hat and gloves on.
At the door stood a perambulator, in which was the
weak cup of tea, propped up with pillows, and carefully
wrapped in a little woollen shawl.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t enjoy my breakfast till I have taken the poor
little thing out for a breath of fresh air,” said the
Crocodile when she came in. “Did you hear how their
tea is?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Oh, quite strong and beginning to draw very nicely,”
said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m sure I’m very glad to hear it,” said the Crocodile,
wiping his eye and looking ruefully at his own weak
tea. “I shall probably not be back for some time,” he
continued, “so, perhaps, I had better say good-bye.
Pray make yourself at home.” And, after shaking hands
with her, the poor old creature went out, looking very
mournful, and tenderly wheeling the perambulator with
the weak cup of tea in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How absurd!” said Girlie to herself; and, after
watching him out of sight, she took her cup and saucer
with her, and went back to the seals.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I say,” said the eldest Seal when she entered the
door, “there’s a letter for you in the post.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you know?” asked Girlie, putting down
the cake, and passing her cup over for some tea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because I put it there,” said the Seal.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Put it where?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In the post,” said the Seal in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What <i>do</i> you mean?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go and see for yourself,” said the Seal, pointing to
the door at the other end of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie walked across and saw that the door-post had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>a number of little slits in it, in one of which was a
letter.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id013'>

<p><span class='small'>“TENDERLY WHEELING THE PERAMBULATOR WITH THE WEAK CUP OF TEA IN IT.”</span></p>

<p class='c014'>Drawing it out, she found it addressed to herself:</p>

opened the envelope, and was greatly disappointed to
find a plain sheet of paper with only the letter “C”
written on it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wasn’t it kind of me to send it?” asked the Seal
when she walked slowly back.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/p049.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘BUT THERE’S NOTHING IN IT,’ SAID GIRLIE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“But there’s nothing in it,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t there a letter?” asked the Seal.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said Girlie; “nothing but a plain sheet of paper
with a big ‘C’ on it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” said the Seal, “that’s a letter, isn’t it,
stupid? I didn’t say that I had sent you a <i>lot</i> of
letters, did I? I thought you would like the letter ‘C’;
it’s such a useful one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it good for?” asked Girlie, who didn’t see
how it <i>could</i> be of much use to her.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“Why, to <i>suggest</i> things, of course,” said the Seal. “You
have only to look at it in order to think of all kinds of
lovely things—<i>cakes</i> and <i>carpets</i>, <i>calico</i> and <i>crockery</i>, for
instance, to say nothing of <i>chocolate creams</i> and <i>crumpets</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course there are <i>some</i> uncomfortable things, too,
such as <i>caterpillars</i>, <i>centipedes</i>, and <i>castor-oil</i>; but, on the
whole, it’s a most useful letter.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes; very different from some,” said the middle-sized
Seal, who had not spoken to Girlie before.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“I had the letter ‘M’ sent to me once,” he continued,
“and immediately had the <i>measles</i>, the <i>mumps</i>, and the
<i>megrims</i>, and did not get over them till somebody
kindly sent me the letter ‘T,’ so that I could have
<i>travelling</i> with <i>tranquillity</i>, and <i>Turkish delight</i>. I wish
some one would send me ‘G,’” he went on, “so that
I could have <i>gooseberries</i> and <i>greengages</i> and <i>grapes</i>.
I’m so fond of fruit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then I should think ‘F’ would be the best letter
to have, wouldn’t it?” asked Girlie. “‘F’ stands for
<i>fruit</i>, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, and <i>frogs</i> and <i>freckles</i> and <i>five-finger</i> exercises,
too,” said the Seal. “No, thank you—not for me. One
has to be very careful, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Just then a great bell began to ring, and the seals
got up hastily and went back to their washtubs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s that?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The public meeting is about to commence next
door,” said the eldest Seal. “Wouldn’t you like to
go?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is it about?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To settle questions,” replied the Seal. “All the
questions and answers are decided at these meetings.
The Wallypug will attend in state,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Oh! I <i>should</i> like to see the Wallypug,” said Girlie
eagerly. “And I have an important question to ask,
too,” she thought, remembering the Goo. “May any
one go?” she asked aloud.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THE SEALS ... WENT BACK TO THEIR WASHTUBS.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said the Seal. “Only you must make haste
or you will be too late. You can go through the
garden, if you like,” he suggested, opening the door for
her, and pointing to a green gate at the end of the
path.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thanked him and, hastily bidding them all good-bye,
ran down the pathway and opened the gate.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>“LATE again!” called out
the Hall Porter when
Girlie hurried up the broad
stone steps leading to a great
building opposite to the little
green gate.</p>
<p class='c014'>“How can I be late <i>again</i>,”
asked Girlie angrily, “when
I’ve never been here at all
before?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“If you’ve not been here
<i>before</i>, then you must have been <i>behind</i>,” said the Hall
Porter; “and, if one is behind, they are late, don’t
you know? You are fined sixpence,” he added, taking
sixpence from his pocket and handing it to Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is this?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“The sixpence that I fined you, of course,” replied the
Hall Porter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what am I to do with it?” asked Girlie in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! findings’, keepings,” muttered the Hall Porter,
walking away. “Put it in your pocket; you’ll want it
soon.”</p>

<p class='c014'>And, sure enough, before she had gone many steps
along the stone corridor, Girlie came to a great door with
the words “Admission, sixpence” written on it.</p>

<p class='c014'>After knocking timidly, she waited awhile, till it was,
at last, opened by a policeman, who, silently taking the
sixpence which she offered him, motioned her to a seat
near the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, it’s a good thing that I <i>was</i> fined, or I should
never have got in here,” thought Girlie; and she sat down
and looked about her curiously.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/p054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘DON’T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM, DEAR.’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>She found herself in a long Gothic hall with low seats
against the wall on each side. At one end was a raised
dais, on which was a throne with a canopy over it. The
centre of the room was quite bare. On the seats against
the wall were sitting a number of animals, and Girlie could
see that the Fish with a cold and his companion the Calf
were sitting near the throne. The Fish had his tail in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a tub of hot mustard-and-water; and by his side was a
small table, on which were a basin of gruel, some cough
mixture and a packet of lozenges. And near him, at a
low desk, sat a Lobster writing rapidly; Girlie afterwards
discovered that he was a Reporter. None of the animals
had taken the slightest notice of her on her entrance
except an old white Cockatoo in a Paisley shawl, carrying
a huge market-basket, and who, as soon as Girlie sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>down, made some remark to two Monkeys who were
sitting near her. The Monkeys laughed, and one of
them, leaning forward so that he could see Girlie more
distinctly, made a grimace at her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t take any notice of them, dear,” said a motherly-looking
Penguin, who sat next to her knitting a very
curiously-shaped stocking. “They are always rude to
strangers; and I think you have not been here before,
have you?” she asked smilingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, never,” replied Girlie, smiling back again, for she
quite took to this kindly-looking creature.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re what they call a Proper Noun, aren’t you?”
asked the Penguin after a pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thought the matter over, and then replied that
she supposed she was, although usually spoken of as a
little girl.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s all the same, my dear,” said the Penguin. “All
girls are nouns, you know, although all nouns are not
girls, which is very funny when you come to think of it,
because——”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before she could finish the sentence, there was a stir
amongst the animals, when a severe-looking gentleman in
black velvet and steel buckles and buttons entered, carrying
a long wand.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Silence!” he cried in a loud voice, and the talking, which
had been going on all over the room, immediately ceased.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Husher,” whispered the Penguin, hastily putting
away her knitting.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Silence!” again called out the Husher, glaring fiercely
at Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I didn’t speak, sir,” said Girlie nervously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, she did! yes, she did!” screamed the Cockatoo.
“She’s been talking ever since she came in,” she went
on noisily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Silence, both of you!” said the Husher, frowning
severely first at Girlie and then at the Cockatoo, and
then walking to the other end of the room, as
a door at the top of some steps near the throne
opened, and two Heralds entered, blowing a blast on
their trumpets.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/p057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“TWO HERALDS ENTERED.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Here comes the Wallypug!” said the Penguin, and
everybody stood up as a kind of procession filed into the
room.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie and the Penguin moved a little nearer the door,
in order to see more distinctly.</p>

<p class='c014'>First in the procession came the Doctor-in-law, smiling
blandly; then the King’s Minstrel came strutting in,
looking more conceited than ever, and carrying a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>roll of music under his arm. He was followed by an
elderly gentleman carrying a microscope.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Royal Microscopist,” said the Penguin in
answer to an inquiring glance that Girlie gave her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What is the microscope for?” asked Girlie in a
whisper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To see the jokes with,” replied the Penguin. “Some
of them cannot be seen at all without it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Following the Royal Microscopist came an old lady in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>a poke bonnet and black lace shawl, who turned out to
be the Head Mistress of the High School at Why. She
was a very sharp-featured person and wore blue glasses.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a slight pause, and then the Wallypug
entered. He was a meek-looking little creature, splendidly
dressed in royal robes, which, however, fitted him very
badly, and his crown was so much too big that it
came quite over his head and just rested on the tip
of his nose. He carried an orb in one hand and a
sceptre in the other. His long velvet cloak, lined with
ermine, was held by two pages, who were giggling
and occasionally giving the cloak a tug which nearly
upset the poor Wallypug, who seemed to have great
difficulty in getting along as it was. (<i>See <a href='#frontis'>Frontispiece</a>.</i>)</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now then, Wallypug, sparkle up!” called out the
Husher, giving him a poke with his wand as soon as
he entered the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie was greatly surprised to see him treated so
disrespectfully, and was quite indignant when, the
Wallypug having reached the steps of the dais, the
pages gave an extra hard pull at his cloak and caused
him to fall awkwardly forward on to his hands and
knees, dropping his orb and sceptre and knocking his
crown further over his face than ever.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Everybody else, however, seemed to think it a great
joke, and even the Wallypug smiled apologetically while
he scrambled nervously up to the throne.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the time that the animals were settling into
their places, Girlie found out from the Penguin that the
Wallypug was a <i>kind of King</i>, governed by the people
instead of governing them. He was obliged to spend
his money as <i>they</i> decided, and was not allowed to do
<i>anything</i> without their permission. He had to address
every one as “Your Majesty,” and had even to wear
such clothes as the people directed. The state robes
he now wore had belonged to the previous Wallypug,
who had been a much larger man, and that was why
they fitted him so badly.</p>

<p class='c014'>So soon as the room was quiet, the Husher announced
in a loud voice, “The Speech from the Throne”; and
the Wallypug immediately stood up, nervously fumbling
at a sheet of parchment which he held in his hand.
His crown being quite over his eyes, he had to hold the
parchment nearly up to his nose in order to see what was
written on it. However, he soon began in a feeble voice,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“May it please your Majesties——” when he was
immediately interrupted by the Cockatoo, who screamed
out,—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“We don’t want to hear all that rubbish! Let’s get
to business.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yes,” cried several voices; “business first.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Husher called out “Silence! silence!” in a dignified
way. “I think you <i>had</i> better sit down, though,”
he added, turning to the Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug, looking
greatly relieved and sitting down immediately.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Husher then walked over to the Fish and seemed
to be asking him some question, to which the Fish
evidently replied in the affirmative, for the Husher
looked very pleased and immediately announced,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ladies and gentlemen——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What about us?” screamed the Cockatoo.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And others,” continued the Husher, giving a glance
in her direction. “You will be pleased to hear that the
Lecture to-day will be given by A. Fish, Esq., and the
subject is one which will no doubt interest you all.
It is ‘<i>The Whichness of the What as compared to the
Thatness of the Thus.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c014'>A storm of applause followed this announcement, in
the midst of which the Fish arose, assisted by his
friend the Calf, who, so soon as he had helped him
to stand, ran hurriedly out of the room, returning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>almost immediately with a large kettle of boiling water
and some more mustard. These he poured hastily into
the tub, stirring it round and round and gazing up
anxiously into the Fish’s face.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id015'>
<img src='images/p058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THE FISH GASPED ONCE OR TWICE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Fish gasped once or twice, and then, after
swallowing a little gruel, he began in a very choky
voice:</p>

<p class='c014'>“O-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, Ladles ad Geddlebed——”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Reporter looked up with a puzzled air. “May
I trouble you to repeat that?” he asked, putting his
claw to his head. “I didn’t quite catch the last part
of the sentence.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“O-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, I said, Ladles ad Geddlebed,” repeated
the Fish, looking rather put out.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Latin quotation?” asked the Reporter of the Doctor-in-law,
who stood near him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Partly,” replied the Doctor-in-law. “‘Ladles’ is
English, ‘ad’ is Latin, and ‘Geddlebed’ is Dutch, I think.
It’s a very clever remark,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Reporter looked greatly impressed, and made a
note of what the Doctor-in-law had said, and then
waited for the Fish to go on.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fish, however, was taking some more gruel, and
saying “O-o-o-b” between every spoonful. Presently he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>choked dreadfully, and, amidst great excitement, had to
be helped from the room by the Calf and the Doctor-in-law,
who kept thumping him violently on the back all
the way to the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>So soon as they had gone out, the King’s Minstrel
jumped up and rapidly began undoing his roll of music.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I will now oblige you with one of my charming songs,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was immediately a great commotion in all parts
of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, you won’t!” “Turn him out!” “We don’t want
to hear it,” was heard on all sides, while the old Cockatoo
got positively frantic, jumping madly up and down, and
screaming out as loudly as she could, “Down with him!
<i>Down with him!</i> <span class='sc'>Down with him!</span>”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Husher rushed wildly about calling out “Silence!
silence!” and it was not until the King’s Minstrel had
sulkily rolled up his music and sat down again that order
was restored.</p>

somebody, when they had

<p class='c014'>Several animals held up their paws.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s have yours first,” he said, turning to a large
black French poodle.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Poodle at once got up and made a very polite bow.
“It’s a ‘Question of Etiquette,’” he said, “and I’ve taken
the liberty of putting it into verse.”</p>

him. “Go on with your question, Poodle.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“First of all,” said the Guineapig, referring to some
notes that he had made, “you said you had <i>heard</i> that
the people of Japan were most polite; now where did
you hear it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I <i>read</i> it in a book,” explained the Poodle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then you didn’t <i>hear</i> it at all, so you are not telling
the truth,” said the Guineapig severely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s the same thing,” argued the Poodle.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s not!” said the Guineapig decidedly. “Now attend
to me,” he continued; “has your cat <i>left</i>?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said the Poodle, “she returned after she had eaten

<p class='c014'>“Then,” said the Guineapig triumphantly, “if she’s

there was some attempt at applause, but the Husher
called out severely, “Silence: next question,” and the Schoolmistress
stood up.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mine’s French,” she said importantly. “Does any one
here understand French?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do, a little,” said Girlie, feeling quite proud of her
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c014'>Several animals on the same side of the room as herself
leaned forward and stared at her curiously.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“Bah! down with the foreigners!” screamed the
Cockatoo.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Silence,” called out the Husher, and every one listened
attentively while the Schoolmistress asked the following
question.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Has the son of the miller the mustard of the daughter
of the gardener?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>That’s</i> not French,” said Girlie contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m <i>sure</i> it is,” said the Schoolmistress; “isn’t it?”
she asked, turning to the Husher.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve seen questions very much like it in my French
lesson book,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then, of course, it’s French,” said the Schoolmistress,
while the Cockatoo screamed out, “Yah! who said she
knew French and didn’t! <i>laugh at her, laugh at her</i>!”
Before Girlie, who felt very indignant, could reply, the
Husher had called out “Family Coach” again, and they
all had to change places once more.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now does any one know the answer?” asked the
Husher, after the Schoolmistress had repeated the question.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Please, sir, I do,” said a meek-looking Donkey. “I
work for the son of the miller, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, has he the mustard of the gardener’s daughter?”
asked the Husher.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Please, sir, yes,” said the Donkey.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you know?” queried the Husher.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because he is so hot-tempered, sir,” replied the Donkey
ruefully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah! then I expect he <i>has</i> got it,” said the Husher
reflectively. “What’s the next question?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/p073.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘OH! I HAVE A QUESTION, IF YOU PLEASE.’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Girlie suddenly remembered about the Goo, and jumped
up, excitedly saying, “Oh! I have a question, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, let’s have it,” said the Husher.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Could you kindly tell me what is a Goo?” asked
Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A what?” said the Husher, frowning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A Goo,” replied Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you spell it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“G-o-o, I think,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Husher looked perplexed. “Family Coach,” he
called at last, and they all scrambled across the room
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now then, what’s a Goo?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>No one spoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t believe she knows herself,” at last called out
the Cockatoo.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course I don’t,” answered Girlie, “or I shouldn’t
have asked the question.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“It’s no use whatever asking questions,” said the Husher
crossly, “if you can’t tell us whether we give you the
correct answer or not; and how can you do that if you
don’t know yourself? Well, you’ll <i>all</i> have to know by
next week,” he continued, “or I shall send you all to
sea.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What good will that do?” asked Girlie of the Penguin,
who was still sitting next to her.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Oh! we always have to go to sea, if we don’t know
things,” replied the Penguin dolefully.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie was just going to ask a further question about
this, when she looked up and saw that the Wallypug was
wriggling nervously about on the throne, and that the
Husher was glaring fiercely at him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t jiffle,” said the Husher, “you make me giddy;
what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m afraid, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug, standing
up and speaking in a frightened voice, “that I shall have
to present another petition.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good gracious!” said the Husher, “what do you want
now? you’re always wanting something or other; last
week it was to have your boots mended, and the week
before you wanted your hair cut, and now you want
something else.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug meekly, “it’s
the same thing. If you remember, you know, you couldn’t
all agree as to whether I might have it cut or not, so I
had to have <i>part</i> of it cut, and now it really looks so very
ridiculous, that I humbly beg that you will allow me to
have the rest taken off.”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a murmuring in the room, and then some one
called out, “Take your crown off.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>The Wallypug did so, and showed that on one side of
his head his hair hung over his ear, while, on the other,
it was quite short.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, it certainly does look rather silly,” said the
Husher. “How much will it cost to have it cut?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Threepence, your Majesty,” replied the Wallypug
meekly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Too much! too much!” screamed the Cockatoo
angrily. “Down with the Wallypug, down with the barbers,
down with everybody and everything.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hold your tongue,” shouted the Husher. “Well,
what shall we say to the Wallypug’s petition,” he continued,
addressing the meeting.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a great argument in which everybody seemed
to take part at once, and, at last, it was decided that the
Wallypug should wait until the <i>short hair</i> grew the <i>same
length as the other</i>, and then he might have it all cut together.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thought this did not seem a very satisfactory
arrangement for the Wallypug, and she felt quite sorry
for him when, sighing disconsolately, and pulling his crown
over his head, he sat meekly down on the throne again,
looking very unhappy.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now,” said the Husher briskly, “I beg to propose that
the Wallypug invites us all to dinner.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Hear, hear!” shouted all the animals.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! please, no,” said the Wallypug nervously. “My
cook would be so <i>very</i> angry with me; he can’t bear me to
bring a lot of people home unexpectedly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>However, the animals would take no denial, so the poor
Wallypug left the hall to make arrangements with his cook
while the rest of the company went home to dress for
dinner, leaving Girlie alone in the room.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>“WELL, I think they <i>might</i>
have asked me to dinner,
too,” thought Girlie, when
she found herself alone. “I
don’t think it’s at all polite of
them to have left me by myself;”
and she was just walking
to the door to go out, when two
ladies entered. They were beautifully dressed
and wore long court trains and a quantity of jewellery.
They were both <i>very</i> plain and did not look at all amiable.</p>
<p class='c014'>“I suppose this is she,” said one, stopping when she
saw Girlie. “We are the Wallypug’s sisters, Belinda and
Lucinda,” she said, “and the Wallypug says that you are
to join us at dinner, so you had better go and dress.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p072.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘I SUPPOSE THIS IS SHE,’ SAID ONE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I’m very sorry,” said Girlie, “but I have no other
dress here.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Hum! well, you can’t go in that, that’s certain!” said
Lucinda, who was the eldest. “She’s very plain, isn’t
she?” she continued, turning to her sister.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! downright ugly!” replied Belinda. “No style or
manners. Aren’t you going to do your hair up?” she
cried, staring at Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve never had it done up yet,” said Girlie. “I’m
not nearly old enough.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What nonsense!” said Belinda, who looked about
fifty. “You don’t hear <i>me</i> say that. Have you ever
been to Court before, child?” she went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I haven’t,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah! I thought not,” said Belinda, sniffing contemptuously.
“A pretty figure <i>you’ll</i> cut in Society. Where
are your jewels?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I haven’t any!” said Girlie. “I have a little gold
chain and a locket, but Mamma will never let me wear
them; she says that jewellery is not suitable for children.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stuff and nonsense!” said Belinda impatiently.
“What accomplishments have you?” she asked after a
pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can play the piano a very little,” said Girlie, “and
I am taking singing lessons.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is that all?” asked Belinda.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“I can recite one or two poems,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Recite!” said Lucinda in a commanding tone, and
the two old ladies sat down and fanned themselves
affectedly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thought for a moment or two, and then stood
up and repeated the following words, although she did
not at all remember ever having heard them before:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I met an ancient dame one day,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She was <i>six years old</i>, she said.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Her hair was grey without a curl—</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>She wore it on her head</i>.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Her face was wan and thin and pale,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her age I could not fix,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But still with many a smirk and smile</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She said, ‘I’m only six.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Nay, if you say you’re six!’ I cried,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘The truth you have forsaken</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘Perhaps I have, perhaps I’ve not,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And maybe I’m mistaken.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“There! there! that will do,” interrupted Belinda,
“that’s horribly rude and you recite it very badly.
Don’t you know anything else?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know ‘The Lobster and the Buttercup,’” said
Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Repeat it then,” cried both sisters at once.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie started again:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A Sailor and a Kangaroo</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Were waltzing round and round.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When suddenly upon the sand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Sailor saw a pound.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I think, my dear, for half a year,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Twill keep us very nicely.’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘Just so,’ the Kangaroo replied,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘Exactly,’ and ‘Precisely.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘What shall you buy, my dearest one,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When you get to the City?’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘Why, tramway lines and butterscotch;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To miss them were a pity.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘We’ll have a cosy little house,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With Sunflowers in the garden</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And, if you ever knock me down,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>I’ll always beg your pardon.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Don’t mention it!’ the Sailor said,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘I’m sure I shouldn’t mind.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And, if you hit me several times,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I’d only think it kind.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Kangaroo then took his arm,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And they went home to tea.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I do not know what kind they used,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I think it was Bohea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Well, that’s a little better, certainly,” said Belinda
when she had finished. “But why is it called ‘The
Lobster and the Buttercup?’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know,” said Girlie, “and I can’t think where
I learned it; the words seemed to come into my head
all at once. I’m afraid it’s very foolish,” she added
apologetically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! it’s positively absurd!” agreed Belinda, “but
there, what <i>can</i> you expect from a person who has
never been in Society? There goes the dinner gong,”
she continued, at the sound of a gong from the next
room, and, followed by Lucinda and Girlie, she led the
way to the door at the side of the throne.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the ante-room adjoining Girlie found the Doctor-in-law
putting on a pair of white kid gloves.</p>

<p class='c014'>“May I take you in to dinner?” he asked, bowing
politely and offering his arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you very much,” said Girlie, laying her hand
on his arm and feeling quite “grown up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This way,” said the Doctor-in-law, pushing aside
some heavy curtains and leading Girlie to a seat at
the long table which reached the whole length of the
handsome Dining Hall in which they now found
themselves.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The Wallypug and most of the guests were already
seated, and Girlie recognised a great many of the
creatures she had seen in the other room, when she
looked around.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What are we waiting for?” asked the Doctor-in-law
of one of the Footmen, of whom there seemed
to be a great number. They were all lizards and
dressed alike in handsome liveries of green and
gold.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There are not nearly enough plates to go round,”
said the Footman in an anxious whisper, “and so we
have had to send out to borrow some;” and he hurried
away, counting the guests on his way, and then making
a calculation on his fingers, and shaking his head mournfully
all the while.</p>

<p class='c014'>After everybody else was seated, the King’s Minstrel
came strutting into the room, dangling his hands as
usual, and nodding in a patronising kind of way to
Girlie; he threw himself down in an unoccupied chair
next to her.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Charming menu, isn’t it?” remarked the Doctor-in-law,
handing her a highly decorated card on which
Girlie read the following words:—</p>
<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>And on the other side of the card Girlie read:</p>

<div class='nf-center c001'>

</div>

<p class='c024'>“Oh! I’ve heard of hunting for a needle in a <i>bottle
of hay</i>,” thought Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you know why it’s called a menu?” asked the
Doctor-in-law, looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said Girlie. “It’s French for something, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said the Doctor-in-law, “it’s English, and it’s
called a menu for two reasons; first, because it’s what
they <i>mean you</i> to have, and, secondly, because it’s between
<i>me and you</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh!” said Girlie. “And why is it called a <i>Fancy</i>
Dinner Party, please?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’ll see directly,” replied the Doctor-in-law, as
the Footman came round with the soup plates.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thick or clear, Miss?” he asked when he came to
Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thick, please,” said Girlie, “because,” she thought,
“Air soup or Water broth must be so <i>very</i> thin.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The Lizard quickly put down a hot, empty plate in
front of her, and then hurried away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you got what you fancied?” asked the Doctor-in-law
politely.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/p085.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THE FOOTMAN CAME ROUND WITH THE SOUP PLATES.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I haven’t anything at all but an empty plate,” said
Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What did you fancy?” asked the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mock treacle,” said Girlie, referring to the card.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, now, you must <i>fancy that you have got it</i>,” said
the Doctor-in-law. “That’s why it’s called a <i>Fancy</i>
Dinner Party,” he continued, breaking some imaginary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>bread into his empty soup plate and then pretending to
eat some with a spoon.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie saw that every one else was doing the same
sort of thing, so she thought that she had better follow
their example.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Although,” she thought, “I should think it must be
<i>very</i> unsatisfactory, if you are really hungry.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Delicious, isn’t it?” asked the Doctor-in-law, wiping
his lips with his serviette.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There doesn’t seem to be much flavour in it,” said
Girlie doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah! you should have fancied real turtle, like me,”
said the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I don’t see it down,” said Girlie, referring to
the card again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! that doesn’t matter in the least,” replied the
Doctor-in-law. “You can fancy just whatever you like;
it doesn’t make the slightest difference. That’s the
best of these Fancy Dinner Parties.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thought that, at least, it must be a very cheap
way of entertaining your friends, but she did not like
to say so for fear of being thought rude.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you found out what a Goo is?” she asked
presently, while the Footmen were removing the plates.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Oh, I knew all along, my dear,” said the Doctor-in-law
smilingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! did you? What is it, please?” asked Girlie,
who thought that she was really going to find out at
last.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I cannot possibly tell you under four shillings and
ninepence-three-farthings,” said the Doctor-in-law. “But
I’ll tell you <i>twice</i> for six shillings, if you like,” he
added considerately.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear!” said Girlie, greatly disappointed. “I’ve
told you before that I really have no money at all
with me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then,” said the Doctor-in-law, pushing his chair
back and getting up indignantly, “I don’t think that
you are at all a respectable person, and I shall certainly
not sit by you any longer. You are the most <i>unprofitable</i>
person that I have ever met with,” he added over
his shoulder as he walked away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear!” thought Girlie, “now he’s offended with
me because I haven’t any money.” But she consoled
herself with the thought that it was really rather fortunate
that she hadn’t; “For I am sure he would soon
get it all away from me, if I had,” she said to herself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Next to where the Doctor-in-law had been sitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>was a little gentleman in brown, with only one eye and
a very turned-up nose, who kept staring at Girlie with
his one eye in a very confusing manner. Girlie fully
expected him to say something, but he only continued
to stare.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“KEPT STARING AT GIRLIE IN A VERY CONFUSING MANNER.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Perhaps he wishes me to say something first,” she
thought. “I hope you are enjoying your dinner, sir,”
she said aloud, very politely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<i>A continual mind is a contemptuous feast</i>,” remarked
the little man, with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m afraid I don’t understand you,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course not—nobody ever does,” said the little
man; “that’s why I’m called an Enigma. I can say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>things far more imcomprehensibly misunderstandable than
that,” he added.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, please don’t!” said Girlie. “I can’t follow you
as it is.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then,” said the Enigma. “Pray allow
me to meditate in silence;” and he folded his arms
and sat perfectly still, staring up at Girlie as
before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Pass his plate,” said the King’s Minstrel, who had
been greedily pretending to eat the whole time, and
had not spoken a word to any one before. “He won’t
want any more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie passed the plate, which was perfectly empty.
“So it can’t possibly do him any harm,” she thought.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder what he fancied,” said the King’s Minstrel,
looking first into the plate and then turning it over
and looking underneath.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Food for reflection. It will do <i>you</i> good,” said the
Enigma, who had overheard him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The King’s Minstrel nervously dropped the plate. “It
doesn’t agree with me,” he said hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“H’m! I don’t wonder at it,” remarked the Enigma
contemptuously, and then sat still, staring as before.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was an awkward silence for some time, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>at last, Girlie asked the King’s Minstrel whether he had
found out what a Goo was yet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes,” answered the King’s Minstrel, immediately
regaining his conceited air. “My uncle, the Duke, keeps
an enormous quantity of them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! what are they like, please?” asked Girlie
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, the usual kind; some large and some small,”
said the King’s Minstrel evasively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But <i>what are</i> they?—birds, or animals, or what?”
asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, to tell you the truth,” said the King’s
Minstrel, “they are neither one nor the other, but
rather more like the other than the one.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How many legs have they?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“A few,” said the King’s Minstrel.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear! How many do you mean?” asked Girlie,
who was getting rather impatient.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Some at each corner,” replied the King’s Minstrel
solemnly; and then, taking up her plate, he looked
into it and inquired what she had fancied.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I forgot to fancy anything,” said Girlie. “I
can’t see that it makes any difference.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then, I shall fancy hothouse screeches,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>said the King’s Minstrel, by which Girlie knew that
they had reached dessert, and that the Dinner Party
would soon be over.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“WAS BEING TURNED OUT OF THE ROOM.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Just then a loud commotion arose at the other end
of the room, causing all to raise hastily from their
seats in alarm. It turned out that the old Cockatoo,
who had been arguing with the black Poodle as to
what the Wallypug should be <i>compelled to fancy</i>, had at
last savagely bitten him, and was being turned out of
the room, screaming and kicking; and, to make matters
worse, in the midst of all this confusion the lights

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>GIRLIE was greatly alarmed
when she found herself in the
dark, the more so that the
noise, which had been going on all
around her, suddenly ceased in a most
mysterious manner. She called aloud
once or twice, but received no reply,
so she began to grope about in the
dark, trying to find her way out. After
knocking herself several times against
the chairs and other furniture in her
endeavours, she, at last, saw a faint
light coming from underneath a door
a short distance down the room. Feeling her way carefully
to it and pushing it open, she found that it led into a
large conservatory. An old man who, she thought, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>be the gardener, was potting some tall plants before a low
bench at the further end of it, and, to Girlie’s great surprise,
she could see that the <i>sun was shining brightly</i>.</p>
<p class='c014'>“Now, that’s very curious,” she thought; “I certainly
thought that it was night time. I’m sure that the gas
was alight while we were having dinner. I’ll ask this
old gentleman.” “Could you please tell me what time
it is?” she said aloud, walking over to the Gardener.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We haven’t got any here, Miss,” he replied mournfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Any what?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Any <i>time</i>, Miss. Haven’t you heard of people not
having any time before?” said the Gardener.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said Girlie, “people that are in a hurry sometimes
say they haven’t any time, but you don’t seem to be
in a hurry about anything.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, <i>that</i> isn’t the reason why we haven’t any time,
Miss; it’s because we’ve lost ours. You’ve heard of people
losing time, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” replied Girlie, “I have.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, if you’ll sit down here, Miss,” said the Gardener,
turning a large flowerpot upside down for her to sit on,
“I’ll tell you how we lost ours. It was like this here,”
he continued, after Girlie was seated. “We’d kept our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>time here for a long while, when one day the young man
as they calls the King’s Minstrel comes along, and he
says, says he, ‘You don’t keep your time properly,’ he
says. ‘What do you mean?’ we says. ‘Well,’ he says,
‘you don’t <i>beat</i> him, do you?’ ‘No,’ we says. ‘What do
we want to beat him for?’ we says. ‘Oh,’ he says, ‘you
have to be very <i>strict</i> with your time,’ he says, ‘and
you ought to beat him to make him go quicker,’ he
says. Well, Miss, some of us, we didn’t hold with these
new-fangled notions at all, but some of the others
wanted to try it, so, after a bit, we took to beating our
time regular, we did, and, for a little while, Miss, he did
go quicker, so quick, in fact, that we couldn’t keep up
to him at all, but were always <i>behind</i> him. You’ve
heard of people being behind time, haven’t you, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes!” said Girlie, “go on, please.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Miss, after a bit our time he began to go
slower again, and by-and-by he slowly passed away
altogether.” The Gardener paused and looked at Girlie
as though he expected her to say something.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where did he go to?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We never knew, Miss; we hunted high and low
for him, but he never came back again, so now we
haven’t any time at all worth speaking of. The King’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Minstrel, he said as how he would teach us to <i>make
time</i>, but bless you, Miss, the time we gets nowadays
ain’t no ways to be compared to the old time what we
used to have, no more than string is like tobaccer,
Miss. Why, our time is awful mixed; look at us now,
for example, we’re in the <i>middle of next week to-day</i>, and
<i>to-morrow</i> is as likely as not to be <i>the day before yesterday</i>.
That’s why I’m cutting these plants down and putting
them into smaller pots, you know, Miss. Then take
the <i>length</i> of the days,” he went on, “some is that <i>short</i>
as you don’t know how to get your clothes on before it’s
time to go to bed again, and others is that <i>long</i> as you’re
obliged to have eight or nine dinners a day, or you
would starve. Then the days of the week, too, there’s
no depending on them; if you’ll believe me, Miss, I’ve
known no less than thirteen Fridays in one week, which
is most unlucky. And last year Midsummer day was
only <i>two days</i> before Christmas, after which we had
<i>three</i> New Year’s days running. As for <i>birthdays</i>, Miss,
it’s quite impossible to tell how old you are. My son Bill,
for instance, has had ever so many more birthdays than
me, owing to his having been born in March, and a little
while ago it kept on being March over and over again,
till I should think that poor boy is a hundred, if he’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>a day. Then, again, how are you to know what wages
to expect when you can’t tell yourself from one day to
another whether you’ll have been in a place three years
and nine months or only two months and a day?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It certainly must be <i>very</i> puzzling,” said Girlie, who
had been listening most attentively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Puzzling ain’t the word, Miss,” said the Gardener.
“Why, look at my poor daughter, now, she was to have
been married on the 19th of June, and dash me if there’s
been any 19th of June for these last twenty years or more,
and now her husband that was to be, young Spuffles,
the Miller’s son, has gone and failed through having put
some Mustard in with his flour by accident.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I heard the Miller’s son had some mustard,”
remarked Girlie, remembering the Schoolmistress’s question.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where did you hear of it, Miss? if I may be so
bold,” asked the Gardener.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, it was one of the questions at the Public
Meeting,” said Girlie. “The Schoolmistress asked ‘Has
the son of the Miller the mustard of the daughter of
the Gardener?’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s like her imperence,” said the Gardener; “but
there, she always <i>was</i> a busy body, she was. Drat the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>hat!” he continued, as a high hat dropped down with
a loud crash on the top of the conservatory and then
rolled off on to the lawn. “They’re having a <i>Hat Hunt</i>
somewheres,” he went on, “and this here one has escaped
them, I expect.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Whatever is a Hat Hunt?” asked Girlie curiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, it’s a kind of game, Miss, that they play hereabouts.
It’s rare fun for them as can run quick.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do they play it?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, Miss, it’s like this here; they wait till there’s
a high wind a-blowin’, and then they throws a lot of
high hats up into the air and try to catch ‘em as
they’re flying about. It’s wonderful, Miss, how them
hats do dodge you, to be sure. I suppose now, Miss,
you’ve never tried to catch a hat when it’s a-blowin’
about, have you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes, I have,” said Girlie. “My own blew off
the other day, and I had to run a very long way
before I could catch it. It would be very easy to catch
this one, though,” she said, looking out on to the lawn
where the hat was lying quite still just outside the
door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not so easy as you think, Miss,” said the Gardener;
“you just try.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Girlie opened the door and stepped out, and was just
going to pick up the hat, when it started rolling off
again. “Bother!” she said, running after it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’d better take this rake with you, Miss, if you
want to catch it,” called out the Gardener, who was
watching her from the door.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id019'>
<img src='images/p090.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“SHE COULD HEAR THE OLD GARDENER LAUGHING LOUDLY AT HER.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Girlie ran back for the rake and then hurried after
the hat, which had stopped under a rose bush. “I’ve
got it this time,” she thought when she came up to it;
but, just when she stretched out her hand to take hold
of it, a sudden gust of wind blew it up into the air
again, and it went sailing merrily off in a most provoking
manner. Girlie made two or three ineffectual
dabs at it with the rake, but could not reach it—she
could hear the old Gardener laughing loudly at her while
he watched her from the conservatory door, and it made
her determined to catch the hat, if she possibly could.
By-and-by it settled down on the top of a low yew
hedge at the end of the lawn, and Girlie hurried after
it, grasping her rake firmly in her hand. When she
reached the hedge she struck out at it rather crossly
with the rake, only to see it go flying off into the
meadow beyond, while a voice on the other side of the
hedge called out in an indignant manner,—</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“I say there, pray be careful what you’re about; do
you know that you very nearly had my head off?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m sure I’m very sorry,” said Girlie, peeping through
the hedge and trying to see who was speaking to her.
She could see nobody, however, so she ran to a little
gate which she could see in the hedge, and then walked
slowly back on the other side to where the voice had
proceeded from.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, he’s gone,” she said aloud, when she got there
and found no one in sight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I’m not, I’m here,” said the voice plaintively;
“can’t you see me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie looked about her but could see no one. “Who
are you, please?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m supposed to be a <i>joke</i>,” said the voice, “though
I have my doubts about it; nobody has ever been able
to see me yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That must be very awkward for you,” said Girlie
pityingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said the Joke, “it is. I’m afraid I shall turn
into a <i>Paradox</i> soon, if it goes on much longer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gracious! what a long word,” exclaimed Girlie.
“Whatever is a Paradox?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“When a thing <i>is</i> what it <i>isn’t</i> and yet <i>isn’t</i> what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>it <i>is</i>, it’s a paradox,” said the Joke. “And since I am
beginning to think it’s no <i>joke</i> to be a <i>joke</i>, I suppose
I must be a kind of paradox,” he added wearily.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie couldn’t think of anything comforting to say,
though she really felt very sorry for the poor Joke,
“for it must be so <i>very</i> uncomfortable to be invisible,”
she thought, “and not even to know yourself what
you really are.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here comes the Royal Microscopist,” said the Joke
a minute or two later. “You might ask him to try and
see me with his microscope, will you please?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie looked across the meadow and saw the Royal
Microscopist and the Doctor-in-law coming along arm-in-arm.
The Doctor-in-law was triumphantly carrying the
hat, which he had evidently succeeded in capturing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They are called chimney-pot hats,” he was explaining,
“because they blow about in windy weather just
as chimney-pots do. That will be two and ninepence,
please;” and he stopped and held out his hand while
the Royal Microscopist fumbled about in his pocket for
his purse. He had just handed the Doctor-in-law half
a sovereign and was waiting for the change, when he
saw Girlie. Hastily putting on his spectacles, he hurried
over to her while the Doctor-in-law pocketed the money.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Bless me!” he cried, staring at her curiously; “the
Human Noun, I do declare! How very singular!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t see why you should think it singular at
all,” said Girlie boldly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t you, my dear? Well, you <i>are</i> singular, very
singular—indeed, <i>most</i> singular—because, you see, there’s
only <i>one</i> of you. Now, if there had been <i>two</i> of you,
you know, you might have been <i>plural</i>, if you wished.
Dear me! what have you done with your <i>Case</i>?” he
asked, peering at her over the top of his spectacles.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My case! What do you mean?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Every respectable Noun is expected to carry a Case,”
said the Doctor-in-law; “you ought to know that by this
time, if you’ve ever been to school. What Mood do you
think she’s in?” he asked, turning to the Royal Microscopist.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Royal Microscopist stared at her a minute or two
over his glasses, and then said in a decided voice,
“Very disagreeable Mood. But then, there’s some excuse
for her, you know; she’s only a Third Person, and the
Third Person is <i>always</i> disagreeable; that’s why ‘<i>two’s</i>
company and <i>three’s</i> none.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why should I be the Third Person, pray?” asked
Girlie, who did not at all approve the way in which
they were talking about her.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“I’m the First Person, my friend here is the Second
Person, and so you must be the Third,” replied the
Royal Microscopist.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s only one thing wrong about that,” said the
Doctor-in-law; “<i>I</i> am the First Person.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Now, that’s <i>too</i> bad of you, Doctor-in-law,” said the
Royal Microscopist. “You know we agreed that we were
to take it in turns to be the First Person.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We didn’t do anything of the sort,” said the Doctor-in-law
angrily. “I’m always the First Person.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! please don’t quarrel,” said Girlie. “Besides, I
think I ought to be the First Person, considering that I
was here first.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ha-ha-ha! she’s got the best of you there,” laughed
the Joke.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Royal Microscopist and the Doctor-in-law both
started and looked about nervously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s that?” whispered the Royal Microscopist in
an alarmed voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Only a Joke,” replied Girlie. “He wants you to
try and see him; he’s afraid he’s turning into a para—para——”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Parachute,” suggested the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I don’t think that was it,” said Girlie. “What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>did you say you were turning into?” she asked of the
Joke.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no answer.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He seems to have gone away,” said the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ha-ha-ha! then I can see it,” laughed the Royal
Microscopist; “that <i>is</i> the joke. He waits till you want
him, and then he goes away,—ha-ha-ha! Very funny,
very funny indeed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t think it’s at all a good joke,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Of course not, my dear,” said the Royal Microscopist;
“it’s a very bad joke, a very bad joke indeed,
to run away just when we wanted him. But it’s very
funny that one should <i>not be able to see him till after
he had gone</i>; that’s really funny, very funny indeed—ha-ha-ha!
hee-hee!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t go on like that or you’ll have a fit,” remarked
the Doctor-in-law crossly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what if I do?” replied the Royal Microscopist.
“I suppose I can have a fit, if I like. I’m
not obliged to ask you, am I? I’ll have two, if I wish.
I’ll have the measles, if I like, and I’ll have the
scarlatina and the croup, if I want to—so there!” and
the Royal Microscopist stamped his foot pettishly.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Don’t be absurd,” said the Doctor-in-law; “and come
along and buy your Excuse, or you will be too late.”</p>

“And this is Thursday—early-closing day, you know;
so, if I don’t hurry up, I shall be too late. Good-bye.
See you later;” and, taking the Doctor-in-law’s arm
again, the old gentleman hurried off, stopping half-way
across the meadow to call out, “Can you run?”</p>

in the meadow after they had
gone. It was very pleasant
resting there in the shade, and
she felt quite happy and contented,
and was just making up
her mind to gather some of the large
marguerites, of which there were a
great many growing amongst the grass,
when a loud “S-q-u-a-a-k” above her head
made her look up. A large Crow was sitting up in the

<p class='c014'>“Well, you see,” he said, “my spectacles have got very
dull, and I thought that, perhaps, you wouldn’t mind lending
me your handkerchief to polish them up with.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! certainly, with pleasure,” said Girlie amiably. “I
wonder how he keeps them on?” she thought. “I’ve never
heard of a bird wearing glasses before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But by this time she had got so used to strange things
happening, that she was scarcely surprised at anything.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thanks,” said the Crow, “bring it up here, please.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How can I?” said Girlie. “I can’t climb right up
there.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m <i>sure</i> I’m not,” said Girlie, feeling very indignant.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you <i>must</i> be,” said the Crow. “Pigs can’t fly,
you know, and if you can’t either, you <i>must</i> be a <i>kind</i> of
pig. Oh, you needn’t get so angry about it,” he continued,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>when Girlie began to remonstrate, “pigs are very nice in
their way, if it wasn’t for their pride.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I didn’t know that pigs were proud before,” said Girlie;
“I’m sure they’ve nothing to be proud of.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s just the people that have nothing to be proud of who
usually fancy themselves most,” said the Crow; “look at
the King’s Minstrel, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, yes, he’s proud enough, certainly,” said Girlie,
laughing in spite of herself. “Do you know him?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Know him?” replied the Crow, “I should rather
think I do. Why, I’ve known him ever since he was a boy,
and he was as proud and stuck-up as an old tin kettle
then.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“As an old tin kettle,” repeated Girlie, “why, however
<i>can</i> an old tin kettle be proud.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Haven’t you ever heard of the pride of a kettle?”
said the Crow, who seemed surprised; “why, they’re the
proudest things out. I knew one once,” he continued,
“who came to a terrible end through his pride and folly.
Shall I tell you about it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I should like you to very much,” said Girlie, “if you
wouldn’t mind coming down here, for it is making my neck
ache <i>dreadfully</i> to keep looking up at you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Crow obligingly flew down and, perching on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>stump of a tree near to where she sat, he repeated the
following story:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in15'>“PRIDE.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In a ditch at the back of the house there dwelt</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A preserved meat tin and a kettle.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>They were both very ancient, and battered, and bent,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In the kettle’s left side was a terrible dent,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the tin was of rusty old metal.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But haughty and proud to the last degree,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They both of them greatly desired</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To be thought very grand, so they practised deceit,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>They called their old ditch ‘<i>A Suburban retreat</i>,’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And spoke of themselves as ‘<i>retired</i>.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If any one happened to pass by that way,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The kettle with infinite scorn</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Would turn up its spout and would haughtily stare,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The preserved meat tin with an ‘awful bored’ air</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would lift up its lid and then yawn.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They flattered each other through thick and thin,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the kettle would frequently say—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘Such an elegant vessel I rarely have seen,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And your label in yellow, and crimson, and green,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Is got up in a charming way.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And the tin, in return, would reply to its friend</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In terms that were dignified,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Would speak of its lid as ‘unique in design’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And would <i>never</i> allude by a word or a sign</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To the dent in the kettle’s left side.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“But alas and alack, for the pride of the two,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Just fancy their horror and fright</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When they heard some one shout in a very cross way,—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘John, pick up this <i>rubbish</i> and take it away,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Don’t let it remain in my sight.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They were carried off that very day,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And thrown on the rubbish heap.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The preserved meat tin was completely smothered</div>
      <div class='line in1'>In ashes and dirt, while the kettle was covered</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With cinders about a foot deep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“Poor things,” said Girlie, laughing; “but it served them
right, though, didn’t it, for thinking such a lot of themselves?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Certainly it did,” replied the Crow, “and, besides that,
the kettle had had <i>one</i> warning before. Pride always has a
fall, you know, and he had had one—that was how he came
to get the dent in his left side. Were you ever on speaking
terms with a kettle?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, never,” said Girlie, laughing at the idea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I suppose not,” said the Crow in a pitying voice;
“they <i>are</i> rather particular to whom they speak, and I
suppose they <i>would</i> draw the line at a pig.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I tell you——” began Girlie; but the Crow didn’t allow
her to finish the sentence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s their voices they are so proud of,” he went on. “I
suppose you’ve heard them sing, haven’t you?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“GIRLIE KINDLY RAN TO HIS ASSISTANCE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“No, I haven’t,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Never heard a kettle sing?” asked the Crow in surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, I have,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I was going to say,” remarked the Crow, “why, I’ve
known them to simply <i>boil over</i> with indignation when their
singing hasn’t been properly appreciated. You might as
well give me that handkerchief now,” he added, holding out
his claw.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie gave it to him and watched him while he rubbed
away at his glasses, which he held in his beak.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you use them for?” she asked presently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! I’m out hunting for a Goo,” answered the Crow,
“and, being rather short-sighted, I am obliged to wear
glasses.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, <i>do</i> you know what a Goo is?” asked Girlie
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said the Crow, “our family have come to the
conclusion that it is a <i>kind of worm</i>, an enormously
large worm, because everybody is so very anxious to
find it, and a worm being the <i>only</i> thing in the world
worth troubling about, it <i>must</i> be a worm. If it isn’t,
it isn’t worth looking for, that’s all,” he added.</p>

<p class='c014'>“O’ugh! I am sure I shouldn’t like to find one, then,”
said Girlie, shuddering.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>The Crow lifted up his eyebrows (such as he had)
in surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There’s no accounting for taste,” he said presently,
in a sarcastic voice; “and pigs—but there, no matter!
I won’t finish it. Hush! what’s that?” he went on,
as a great bell tolled in the distance. “The curfew,”
he said, after listening for a minute, “now we shall
all have to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But how can we?” cried Girlie in alarm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There are plenty of trees,” suggested the Crow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I can’t sleep in a tree,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, can’t you? well, you’ll have to to-night, anyhow,”
said the Crow. “The Watchman will be along presently
and, if he catches you awake, he will <i>extinguish</i> you,
and then where will you be?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thought that sounded very terrible, so she began
looking about for a tree with branches low enough for
her to climb into.</p>

<p class='c014'>She found one presently that she thought she could
manage, and, after several efforts, she succeeded in
reaching one of the lower branches. On the branch that
she had selected were two owls huddled close together.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I say, further up there!” shouted the Crow, giving
one of them a poke as he settled down beside him.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>The Owl immediately opened his eyes very widely and
tried to look as though he had not been to sleep at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s that?” he said, staring hard at Girlie, who
was sitting uncomfortably on the branch.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Crow whispered something in his ear and Girlie
could just catch the word “Pig.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is she really?” said the Owl, looking surprised.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Pig! Do you happen to have any mice about
you?” he said, peering at her curiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good gracious, no!” said Girlie, frightened at the
very idea.</p>

<p class='c014'>“One would think you didn’t <i>care</i> for mice by the
way in which you speak,” said the Owl crossly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shouldn’t be at all surprised if she didn’t,”
remarked the Crow; “her tastes are <i>most</i> peculiar.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“She’s perching very awkwardly, too,” said the Owl,
staring at her with a puzzled air. “What’s the matter
with her?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose Pigs <i>can’t</i> perch properly,” remarked the
Crow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You’re very rude, both of you,” said Girlie, completely
losing her temper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, <i>four perches make one rood</i>,” said the Crow,
counting them.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“I suppose you think that’s clever,” said Girlie, “but
it isn’t, for four perches <i>don’t</i> make one rood—it’s
forty.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s the same thing,” said the Crow, “isn’t it?” he
asked, turning to the Owl, who had shut his eyes
again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Precisely,” he replied, opening one eye only, which
made him look exactly as if he was winking.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How do you make that out?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I could show you, if I had a piece of paper and
a pencil,” said the Crow. “How do you write forty?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Four and a nought,” said Girlie promptly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what does nought stand for?” asked the
Crow.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing,” replied Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, then, <i>what’s the use of making a fuss about
nothing</i>?” said the Crow; “and, besides, if you’re not
a Pig, prove it by perching properly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie felt that she ought to do <i>something</i> to show
them that she really was not a Pig, so she drew her
feet up under her and tried to sit as much like the Owl
as she could. She felt dreadfully uncomfortable, however,
and was afraid every moment that she should fall to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the ground. “Oh, I really can’t do it any longer,”
she said after a little while, resuming her former
position.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Owl and the Crow looked at each other meaningly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/p118.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘PRECISELY,’ HE REPLIED.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I said she was,” nodded the Crow, “and that settles
it. Now let’s go to sleep, or we shall have the Watchman
catching us talking,” and he took off his spectacles
and tucked them under one wing, and then, popping his
head under the other, was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie nestled up as close to the Owl as she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>for he looked so soft and warm, and, resting her head
cosily against his fluffy feathers, was soon asleep herself.
Perhaps it was because of the strange position
in which she was sleeping, but certainly from some
cause or other, she had a most alarming dream. She
thought that she had fallen from the tree and couldn’t
get up again, and that the Watchman (who seemed to
be a dreadful old man with an enormously long nose,
wearing a long coat with ever so many little capes to
it, and carrying a lantern in one hand and an immense
extinguisher in the other) came along and found her
sitting there. He seemed to be very angry that she
was not asleep, and, crying out in a loud voice, “Lights
out,” popped the great extinguisher over her head.
Girlie felt half-suffocated and was just wondering whether
she would really <i>go out</i> like a candle, and was thinking
that she should know now what people meant when
they spoke about being <i>very much put out</i>, when she
suddenly awoke and found, to her great relief, that it
was only a dream. It was broad daylight again and
the Crow had disappeared, carrying Girlie’s pocket-handkerchief
away with him.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose I ought to wake these owls up,” she
thought, looking at them snuggled close to her. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>gave the one on her right a little shake and he
immediately opened his eyes very widely, as before.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/p120.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>THE WATCHMAN.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what is it?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s time to get up,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It isn’t,” said the Owl. “Fluffy and I are going
to sleep all day.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Oh, is that his name—Fluffy?” repeated Girlie,
looking at the other Owl. “What’s yours?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stuffy,” said the Owl, yawning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh!” said Girlie. “Shall I tell you mine?” she
asked, wishing to be sociable.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You can, if you like,” said the Owl.</p>

<p class='c014'>This didn’t sound very encouraging. “But, perhaps, he
isn’t quite awake yet,” thought Girlie, remembering that
people are often rather cross if spoken to before they
are quite awake. “My name is Girlie,” she said
aloud.</p>

<p class='c014'>“H’m! What a stupid name!” said the Owl. “What
does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m sure it isn’t stupid,” cried Girlie indignantly; “it’s
a very pretty name.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s a silly name for a <i>Pig</i>,” persisted the Owl.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I tell you I’m <i>not</i> a Pig,” said Girlie, getting
quite cross.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, I know you <i>say</i> so,” said the Owl sarcastically;
“but I can’t see the difference myself. You can’t perch,
you can’t fly, you haven’t feathers, and you don’t like
mice. If you’re not a Pig, I should just like to know
<i>what</i> you are. Not that it matters in the least, though,”
he went on, before Girlie could reply. “And now <i>do</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>leave off talking, for I want to get to sleep again.” And
he settled his head down between his shoulders and
closed his eyes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p122.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“RAN TO THE GATE AND LOOKED OVER THE TOP.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>He evidently did not wish to continue the conversation,
so Girlie scrambled down from the tree and began
to walk towards the gates at the farther end of the
meadow, gathering some marguerites on her way.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder what day it is?” she thought. “Let’s see,
it was Wednesday afternoon when I first came here;
then I had tea (or breakfast—which was it?) at the
Crocodile’s; then late dinner at the Wallypug’s; and then
it was daylight when I got into the conservatory, so I
suppose that must have been Thursday; and now I’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>been to sleep; so this must be Friday. What a short
day Thursday must have been, though,” she thought—“about
an hour and a half long,” she decided, after
thinking it over; and then, hearing a noise in the
roadway, she ran to the gate and looked over the
top.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>IT was the Wallypug running down the
road at a furious pace. He had his big
crown tucked under one arm and his royal
cloak caught up under the other. Although
he was evidently in a very great hurry, he
politely tried to bow (<i>without stopping</i>) when
he saw Girlie. The consequences, however,
were most disastrous, for, completely losing his balance,
he stumbled forward head over heels and then fell flat on
his back, while his crown went rolling away into the ditch
at the side of the road. His cloak had somehow become
entangled with his legs, preventing him from getting up,
so he lay there kicking and struggling in the most ridiculous
manner imaginable.</p>
<p class='c014'>Girlie kindly ran to his assistance, and, although bursting
with laughter, somehow or other managed to keep a grave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>face while she tried to disentangle the cloak from his
legs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope you have not hurt yourself much,” she said
when the Wallypug at last struggled to his feet.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no, your Majesty, thank you,” he said breathlessly.
Then, nervously looking around him, he said in a solemn
voice, “I do hope, though, no one else saw me fall, for
I am liable to a fine of three and sixpence for being
undignified in public, and I am afraid that I <i>must</i> have
looked rather undignified while I was lying on the ground.
Oh dear! wherever is my crown?” he continued, looking
about him anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie kindly fetched it from the ditch, which was
fortunately a dry one, and handed it back to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>After examining it carefully, the Wallypug drew a small
piece of wash-leather from his pocket and began to polish
it up, remarking that he had always to keep the regalia
bright himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where were you going to in such a hurry?” asked
Girlie, while the polishing operations were going on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, to the Excursion, your Majesty,” said the
Wallypug. “This is Bank Holiday, you know, and there
is to be an excursion to the seaside. Aren’t you
going?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“I should like to very much,” said Girlie, “but I have
no money with me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, it’s quite free, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug.
“<i>I</i> have to pay for it all, you know. I always have to
provide an excursion for the people on Bank Holidays,
and one more or less won’t make the slightest difference,
so you are quite welcome to go.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you very much indeed,” said Girlie. “What time
does the train start?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I haven’t the remotest idea, your Majesty,” said the
Wallypug. “We never <i>do</i> know when the trains are
going to start here; the Porter and the Station-master
settle all that between themselves.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then however do you know at what time to get to the
station?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We <i>don’t</i> know, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug.
“So we just get there as early as we can and then take
our chances as to how long we have to wait. How does
this look now?” he continued, pulling his crown over his
head and drawing himself up with the most comical attempt
at looking dignified.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very nice, indeed,” said Girlie, trying hard not to
laugh.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, your Majesty, let’s be going then,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the Wallypug, leading the way down the road. “I’m afraid
it’s going to rain,” he said a minute or two later, looking
anxiously up into the sky. “We had better hurry to the
station,” and, taking Girlie’s hand, they began to run.
They had not gone far, however, before Girlie felt a drop
of rain on her forehead, then another, and another.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We shall have to shelter somewhere,” said the Wallypug,
looking about for a tree to stand under.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t that a house?” said Girlie, pointing further down
the road. “Perhaps they would let us stop there till the
shower is over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes, your Majesty; that is Madame Penguin’s shop.
I daresay she would be quite pleased to see us. Let’s
hurry on.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So they hastened forward and soon reached the little
shop which stood at the corner of four cross roads. It was
a little, low, one-storied sort of cottage built of stone.
In the windows were a number of odd-looking packages and
envelopes, and over the doorway there swung a sign bearing
the words:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div>Microscopist</div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>Excuse Maker to the Wallypug and the Royal Family.</span></div>
    <div class='c000'><i>Elaborate Excuses prepared at the Shortest Notice.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>The Wallypug opened the door, causing the little bell
fixed to it to tinkle violently.</p>

<p class='c014'>Madame Penguin (who turned out to be the same Penguin
Girlie had seen at the Public Meeting) came hurrying out
of a little room at the back of the shop.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! <i>how</i> do you do?” she said when she saw Girlie,
“and how are you, Wallypug?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Quite well, your Majesty, thank you, quite well,” said
the Wallypug. “We were caught in the shower, and
thought that, perhaps, you wouldn’t mind us sheltering
here for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Delighted, I’m sure,” said Madame Penguin kindly,
bustling about and placing some chairs for them to sit on.
“Oh! you are wondering what are those little things in
the glass cases, aren’t you, dear?” she said to Girlie, who
was looking about her curiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, yes, I was,” admitted Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Those are <i>Promises</i>, my dear,” explained Madame
Penguin, “and we have to keep them in glass cases
because they are so very brittle; as it is, we get a great
many broken ones, and then we have to sell them like this;”
and she fetched a tray from the window with some little
packages piled on it, marked “BROKEN PROMISES,
<i>three-a-penny each</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“<i>What</i> a funny price!” thought Girlie, confusedly trying
to reckon how much a dozen would cost at that rate, and
having to give it up at last.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you sell many of them?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, a great many,” said Madame Penguin, “but
<i>Excuses</i> sell best. You see, we keep all kinds, and
children buy a lot of ‘<i>Excuses for not doing home
lessons</i>‘ and ‘<i>Excuses for staying away from school</i>.’
Then some people buy dozens at a time, for they never
like to be without one, and just now I am having a great
run on my ‘<i>Excuse for not having found a goo</i>.’ You
see, nearly everybody wants one. I sold one yesterday
to the Royal Microscopist. Can I show you a few?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m afraid I can’t buy any, for I have no money,”
said Girlie, while the Wallypug, after fumbling about in
his pocket for a minute, asked,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you any very cheap ones?” “You see, I have
eighteenpence a week to spend as I like,” he explained to
Girlie, “so I will buy you one, if you wish.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s very kind of you,” said Girlie, “but please don’t
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Madame Penguin, however, had reached down a large
brown box filled with little packages, and placed it on
the counter.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>“This is a very good kind,” she said, picking out a blue
one marked (extra fine); “the price is only fourpence
halfpenny. The sixpenny ones are all sold. I have them
as low as a penny each, though I don’t usually recommend
them. Some people, however, who think that even
a <i>bad excuse is better than none</i>, buy them.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id020'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘THIS IS A VERY GOOD KIND,’ SHE SAID.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug said he would have the one marked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>fourpence halfpenny, and, after a struggle, drew his
handkerchief out of his pocket with eighteenpence all in
coppers tied up in one corner of it. Solemnly counting
out fivepence, he waited for the change, and then carefully
tying it up in his handkerchief, which he put back
into his pocket, he handed Girlie the Excuse with a low
bow, politely begging her to accept it as a little present.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie thanked him and began to undo the package,
which she found contained a sheet of foolscap paper with
the following words beautifully written on it:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c025'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“What a <i>splendid</i> excuse!” said the Wallypug, when
Girlie had finished reading it aloud. “They can’t get
over that, can they? You see, they can either believe it
or not just as they like. Did you think of it all yourself,
your Majesty?” he said, turning to Madame Penguin, who
was looking greatly pleased at his praise of her Excuse.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“Yes,” she said; “you see, I get quite a lot of new
ideas from people who come in and out of the shop.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“SHE COULD SEE THAT THE SHOWER WAS OVER.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I must say, your Majesty, that your Excuses
are not like those of some people, who use the same
ones over and over again. Now, I’m sure no one has
heard <i>that</i> Excuse before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh no,” said Madame Penguin, “I always make it
a rule to have a different Excuse every time.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>While they were talking, Girlie walked over to the
door and looked out. She could see that the shower was
over, and she came back and told the Wallypug so.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, then, we must be going,” he said. “I’m sure
we are very much obliged to your Majesty for allowing
us to shelter here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, don’t mention it,” said Madame Penguin, coming
to the door to see them off.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Aren’t you coming to the excursion, too?” asked
Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, dear,” said Madame Penguin. “I am going to
stop at home and write an excuse for not going. Good-bye;”
and, after shaking hands with them both, Madame
Penguin hurried back into her little shop.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>“IS it far to the Station?” asked
Girlie, while they were walking
along.</p>
<p class='c014'>“Oh no, your Majesty, only
just past the Crocodile’s lodge
there,” replied the Wallypug,
when they turned the corner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I know the Crocodile
and I remember where we are,
now,” said Girlie, when the Lodge
came in sight. “I wonder
whether that disagreeable Porter
is still at the Station,” she thought; “and whatever
<i>shall</i> I do, if he remembers about the ticket?”</p>

<p class='c014'>However, she decided not to worry about it till it was
necessary, and hurried along with the Wallypug till they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>reached the Lodge, at one of the upper windows of
which Girlie could see the three Seals. They flapped
their fins at her, and one of them called out, “We are
coming, too, by-and-by.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The great iron gates leading into the Station yard
were wide open, and the courtyard was crowded with
all kinds of animals, each carrying either a little basket
or a bag, which, Girlie concluded, must contain their
luncheon.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Husher was bustling about amongst them, calling
out “Silence! silence!” but no one was paying the
slightest attention to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Inside the Station, the doors of which were closed,
Girlie could see through the window the Porter excitedly
arguing with a very fat Rhinoceros in a uniform,
who, Girlie decided, was the Station-master. She could
not hear what they were saying, but the Porter seemed
to be very angry about something or other and was
gesticulating violently.</p>

<p class='c014'>It turned out afterwards that they were quarrelling as
to the meaning of 10 <i>a.m.</i>, which was the time fixed
for the train to start; the Station-master arguing that
<i>a.m.</i> stood for <i>any morning</i>, and the Porter declaring
that it meant <i>after meals</i>. While waiting for them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>decide, Girlie, who had lost sight of the Wallypug in
the crowd, saw the Crocodile standing a little way in
front of her, looking very sad indeed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id020'>
<img src='images/p137.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THE PORTER SEEMED TO BE VERY ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder what’s the matter with him,” she thought,
trying to get nearer to him. “How do you do,
Mr. Crocodile?” she called out, when she had got within
speaking distance.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Crocodile started and turned around nervously.
“Oh! how do you do?” he said, when he saw her.
“Stop a minute and I’ll come over to you”; and,
pushing his way through the crowd, he was soon by
Girlie’s side.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How is your tea getting on?” she asked, after they
had shaken hands.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The Crocodile burst into tears. “Haven’t you heard?”
he asked, sobbing.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said Girlie. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Crocodile shook his head sadly.” I had a
dreadful accident with him on the day that I last saw
you,” he said. “After I left you, I was wheeling him
down the road, and had just got to the corner, when
I stumbled against a stone and turned the perambulator
right over.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Dear me!” exclaimed Girlie. “And what happened
to your tea?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“He was so <i>upset</i>, poor little thing! that he never
got over it,” said the Crocodile, sobbing convulsively.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! don’t cry,” said Girlie.  “It’s positively absurd
to cry about a cup of tea, you know.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is it?” said the Crocodile. “I’ve never thought about
it in that light before; perhaps it is”; and he dried
his eyes and began to smile. “Crocodiles,” he said,
“are very easily moved to tears. Why, I remember a
friend of mine, who lives in the River Nile, once telling
me that just because a little black baby, whose mother
left it alone on the bank near to where my friend lived,
disappeared, he <i>wept bitterly</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where did the baby disappear to?” asked Girlie.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
<img src='images/p139.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘OH! DON’T CRY,’ SAID GIRLIE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Crocodile only winked and said in a curious
way, “My friend said it was a <i>most delicious</i> baby,”
which didn’t help Girlie to understand in the least what
he meant.</p>

<p class='c014'>While she was still puzzling about it, the Porter
came to the door and began ringing a great hand-bell,
and every one hurried into the Station and down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>steps on to the platform, where a train was waiting
for them.</p>

<p class='c014'>A great scrambling took place to secure seats, and
Girlie was just comfortably settling herself in the same
carriage with the Wallypug (who beckoned to her from
one of the windows), and a family of five Hippopotami,
when the Porter came to the door and, after glaring
at her for a moment in silence, walked rapidly
away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He means mischief, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug;
“I can tell it by his eye. Here he comes again,” he
continued, as the Porter returned, followed by the
Station-master.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There!” he cried, pointing to Girlie scornfully,
“that’s it. The Crow says it’s a Pig, and the Doctor-in-law
says it’s a Noun without a Case, and I’m bothered
if I can tell <i>what</i> it is. If it’s a Pig, it ought to go in
the cattle-truck; and, if it’s the other thing, it ought to
ride with the Alphabet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Station-master scratched his head thoughtfully and
looked much puzzled. “Let’s go and see whether there’s
room in the Alphabet’s carriage for her,” he said after a
pause; and they both walked off again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If you are going to ride with the Alphabet, your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Majesty,” said the Wallypug hurriedly, when they had
gone, “let me give you a little piece of advice. Sit
perfectly still and don’t say a word and you will hear
them talk. It’s most amusing, for, you see, they can
only <i>do</i> or <i>say</i> such things as begin with the letter they
represent. But you must be sure not to speak, or they
will cease talking directly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Before he could say any more, the Porter returned,
and, motioning Girlie to follow him, he showed her into
another carriage, where she found the whole of the
Alphabet sitting.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was rather a squeeze to find a seat at all, but
Girlie at last managed to settle herself in the corner
against the window, and, as soon as she had done so,
the Porter slammed the door to and, blowing his whistle,
called out, “Right away”; and the train slowly steamed
out of the Station.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie determined to sit quite still, as the Wallypug
had advised her, and, after a little while, this is what
happened.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c014'>“She seems strangely silent,” said <i>S</i>, staring solemnly.
“Supposing she’s stuffed!” she suggested stupidly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ridiculous!” remarked <i>R</i>, rearranging railway rug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, well! we’ll wait, won’t we?” whispered <i>W</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cautious creature!” cried <i>C</i> cheekily.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>T</i> tittered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do, dear,” demanded <i>D</i> delightedly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>S</i> smilingly started singing.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>G</i> groaned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Somebody seems sad,” said <i>S</i> sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ridiculous rubbish!” remarked <i>R</i> rudely.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>S</i> stopped singing. She seemed sadly surprised. “Some

<p class='c014'>“Encore! encore!” echoed <i>E</i> encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>A</i> also applauded.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>S</i> seemed satisfied; so she smilingly started singing same

sleepily.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Watch,” whispered <i>W</i>, winking wickedly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>S</i> soon slept, snoring sonorously. Suddenly she started,

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>GIRLIE found the Wallypug sitting on a
little heap of sand under the cliff, when
she reached the shore, whither she had
followed the others from the Station.
He was stuffing some paper into his
crown to make it fit more comfortably.</p>
<p class='c014'>“I am just wondering, your Majesty,”
he remarked when she came up to him, “whether
it would be considered <i>quite</i> dignified of me to paddle.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie could not remember ever having heard of a king
paddling before, and told him so.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, perhaps I’d better not,” he said regretfully; “we
<i>might</i> build a sand castle, though, mightn’t we?” he
suggested, after considering a minute.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“Oh yes,” assented Girlie, clapping her hands, “that
would be fun.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So they set to work to build a large one. Girlie found
a nice flat piece of wood to dig with, and the Wallypug had
brought a little tin pail, which, he said, he always carried
with him when he went to the seaside.</p>

<p class='c014'>While they were digging the moat Girlie told him about
the Alphabet and what had happened in the train.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I quite liked that <i>S</i>,” she said, “she was so kind and
forgiving.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” said the Wallypug, “almost everything that begins
with <i>S</i> is kind; look at the Sea, for instance, see how kind
and sympathetic that is.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie couldn’t quite see what he meant, so she asked him
to explain.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” he said, carefully moulding some little sand
towers for the top of the Castle, “I found it <i>very</i> sympathetic
when I told my troubles to it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, what did it do?” asked Girlie curiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It sighed, your Majesty, <i>the sea sighed</i>,” he said;
“wasn’t it kind of it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very,” laughed Girlie. “I wonder why the sea is so
salt,” she asked presently; “do you know?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s the fish, I expect, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“The fish,” exclaimed Girlie; “why, what have they to do
with it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, most fish are salt, you know,” said the Wallypug;
“haddocks, kippered herrings, codfish, anchovies and
some kinds of sprats; they are all salt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh yes, so they are,” said Girlie; “I wonder I never
thought of that before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They were getting on nicely with the sand castle, and,
presently, the Wallypug suggested that they should look for
some shells to put around it. So they wandered down nearer
to the sea and were looking about for the shells, when an
Ancient Mariner came up to them and, pulling a lock of hair
that hung down over his forehead, said in a gruff voice,
“Fine day for a sail, gentlefolks.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, it is,” replied Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Would you like to go, your Majesty?” asked the Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very much indeed,” said Girlie delightedly, for she was
very fond of the water.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How much do you charge?” asked the Wallypug of
the Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sixpence a head,” said he.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, we’ll go, then,” said the Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Ancient Mariner touched his forelock again and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>muttered something about “going to fetch the horse and
cart.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What does he mean?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! we always go to sea in a cart here,” said the
Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not in a boat?” asked Girlie in surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear no, your Majesty,” said the Wallypug, “they
are so dangerous, you know, and are always getting capsized.
Now, you’ve <i>never</i> heard of any one’s being shipwrecked in
a cart, have you?” he went on.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” said Girlie, “I never have, certainly, but it <i>does</i>
seem a funny way to go to sea, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Not at all,” said the Wallypug. “Haven’t you ever been
to sea in a cart before?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, that I haven’t,” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How used you to get to your bathing-machines at
Broadstairs?” asked the Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, we did go out to <i>them</i> in a cart when the tide
was low, certainly,” said Girlie, wondering however the
Wallypug knew that she had been to Broadstairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well, then, you <i>have</i> been to sea in a cart,”
said the Wallypug; “I thought you had.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But not right out,” argued Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s all the same, your Majesty,” remarked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Wallypug; and at this moment the Ancient Mariner
returned leading a very lean horse harnessed to a clumsy-looking
waggon with low seats running along each side
of it, and with steps at the back, like a bathing-machine.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All aboard, please,” he sang out, climbing up into
his seat and cracking his whip.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie and the Wallypug scrambled up the steps, and
the Ancient Mariner held out his hand for the fare,
which he said he must have before starting.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug paid him from his little store in the
handkerchief, and they were just driving into the sea,
when they heard a voice calling from the shore,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hi! hi! stop, ship ahoy, there!” and, turning round,
they beheld a very stout woman with a baby in her
arms running towards them, and Girlie noticed, to her
great dismay, that it was the Porter’s wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Bathing-machine Woman,” said the Ancient
Mariner. “All right, Mum, we’ll wait for you; don’t
flurry yourself,” he called out.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bathing-machine Woman continued to run and
at last reached them. Climbing breathlessly up the
steps, she threw herself down on the seat, panting
heavily.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Where do you want to go to, Mum?” asked the
Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Home,” panted the Bathing-machine Woman, pointing
to a bathing-machine a long way out.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id020'>
<img src='images/p152.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘HI! HI! STOP, SHIP AHOY, THERE!’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“That will be sixpence,” said the Ancient Mariner.
“Babies in arms not charged for.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve only got fourpence halfpenny,” said the Bathing-machine
Woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I can’t take you for that, you know,” said the
Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I’ll pay the difference,” said the Wallypug
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>kindly, taking the last of his little store of coppers
out of his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bathing-machine Woman thanked him, and the
Ancient Mariner, after pocketing the money, cracked his
whip again and off they started into the water.</p>

<p class='c014'>For some time the water only came half-way up the
wheels; but, after a time, when they got a little distance
from the shore, the cart began to float and the horse
to swim, and they rose up and down on the waves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie did not feel in the least alarmed and quite
enjoyed it; the sun glittered on the water and they
floated merrily onward. Presently she began to be aware
that the Bathing-machine Woman was staring at her
very curiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I seem to know your face, somehow,” she said at
last, frowning thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you?” said Girlie, who did not feel at all
inclined to tell her where they had met.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, yours is such a pretty face, you know, my
dear, that one cannot easily forget it,” said the Bathing-machine
Woman, rocking her baby to and fro.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, come, that’s much better,” thought Girlie.
“Why, she seems to be quite amiable;” and she
wondered what was coming next.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>No one spoke, however, for some time, and, at last,
the Wallypug proposed that somebody should sing a
song.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, that would be lovely,” said Girlie. “Won’t
you please sing something, Ma’am,” she said to the
Bathing-machine Woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, I used to sing once, dear,” she replied, looking
pleased at having been asked, “but I’ve no voice now;
he’ll sing, if you ask him, though,” she continued,
nodding her head towards the Ancient Mariner, and then
going up to him and giving him a poke with her finger.
“The young lady wants you to sing,” she shouted.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I sing only one song and that you know,” he said,
turning round.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, won’t you sing it now, please?” pleaded Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, I will if you wish, Miss,” said the Ancient
Mariner. “It was written specially for me by a gentleman
who came out in my horse and cart one day.”
And, taking his pipe from his mouth, he began
singing in a gruff voice the following song:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For ‘sixpence a head,’ the Mariner said</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Then ho! heave ho! the wild winds did blow,</div>

      <div class='line'>While the Skipper persisted in spinning long yarns</div>
      <div class='line in4'>About his old ship called the <i>Polly</i>.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yes! ‘sixpence a head,’ was all that he said,</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line in4'>And deeply regretted our folly.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>They all clapped their hands when he had finished,
and Girlie laughingly said, “she hoped that he was not
the Mariner referred to in the song.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, I am, Miss,” he admitted, “but I sha’n’t
ask any of <i>you</i> for sixpence more, d’ye see, for I know
that you haven’t got it;” which was perfectly true, for
Girlie had none and the Wallypug had given the last
of his little store of coppers to make up the Bathing-machine
Woman’s sixpence.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear! I’m afraid there’s going to be a squall,
your Majesties,” said the Wallypug suddenly, looking
with alarm at the Bathing-machine Woman’s baby,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>which was screwing up its face in a very ominous
manner.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id020'>
<img src='images/p157.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“BROKE LOOSE AND SWAM AWAY.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“Bless me, yes, so there is!” said the Ancient
Mariner, becoming greatly excited, jumping up on the
seat and shouting out a lot of orders in a loud voice.
“Now then, belay there, hoist the main jib, hard-a-port,
three sheets in the wind, shiver my timbers and blow
me tight!” (I am grieved at having to record these
terrible expressions, but I am sorry to say that sailors
are not at all particular in their language when they
get excited.)</p>

<p class='c014'>The baby began to cry, the sea grew rougher and
rougher every minute, and the cart tossed about in a
most alarming manner.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie was rather frightened. “Do you think there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>any danger?” she asked of the Wallypug, who was
nervously clinging to the side of the cart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>You are requested not to speak to the man at
the wheel</span>,” roared the Ancient Mariner, and, just then,
the horse, which had been plunging about violently,
broke loose and swam away, leaving the cart to float
by itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bathing-machine Woman screamed and the baby
squalled louder than ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear! oh dear! whatever shall we do now?” cried
poor Girlie, while the Wallypug still clung to the side
of the cart, looking very pale indeed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Land ahoy, on the starboard side,” called out the
Ancient Mariner presently, when an island came in sight
to the right of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There, now we are going to be <i>cart</i>wrecked, I
suppose,” cried Girlie, as they drifted towards it (for
she thought that this must be the proper word to use
under the circumstances). She was greatly relieved, however,
to find that the cart, when they neared the island,
rose quietly on a large wave, which lifted them gently
on to the sand and then receded, leaving them high
and dry on the shore.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<img src='images/p159.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>THEY all scrambled down from
the cart and looked at each
other in dismay.</p>
<p class='c014'>“Whatever shall we do
now?” said the Ancient
Mariner. “I’ve never had
such a thing happen to me
before.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Explore the island,” said
Girlie promptly. “People <i>always</i> do that the first thing
when they get cast on a desolate island.” You see she
had read so many of her brothers’ books about shipwrecks
and adventures of that kind that she knew exactly what
to do. “Then we must build a hut,” she went on
(thinking of Robinson Crusoe), “and stop here till some
passing ship sees our signals of distress and rescues us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Oh! it <i>will</i> be lovely!” and Girlie danced about delightedly.
The others did not seem to be half so pleased
about it as she did, and the Wallypug remarked dejectedly
that he “didn’t see what they should do for
food.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! you and the Ancient Mariner will have to go
out shooting game and things, and catch fishes and
turtles,” said Girlie, “and we will stop at home and cook
them and keep the house tidy; that’s the way people do
in books.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But we haven’t any guns to shoot with,” objected the
Ancient Mariner.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was rather puzzling, and Girlie had to think some
time before replying; at last, however, she said decidedly,
“Oh, I know; of course there will be a chest washed
ashore presently, with all kinds of tools and guns in it,
and another one with ship’s biscuits and tinned meats;
that is what always happens in the story books. I expect
we shall find them here when we’ve done exploring the
island. Come along.” And Girlie led the way through
the bushes and trees, which grew so close together that
they had some difficulty in getting along, especially the
Bathing-machine Woman, who, as you will remember, was
rather stout. At last, however, they came to an opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and could see a sandy desert stretching before them apparently
for miles, for they could only just catch a faint
glimpse of the sea sparkling in the sunlight on the
further side of the island.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, this is a rum-looking place to come to,” said
the Ancient Mariner as he viewed the scene.</p>

<p class='c014'>“H’m! there don’t seem to be many shops about,” said
the Bathing-machine Woman, “and I hate a place without
shops, it’s so dull. I don’t think I shall stop here,”
she said (though she didn’t say how she was going to
get away).</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wonder what that thing over there is?” said Girlie,
shading her eyes and looking at what seemed to be a very
curiously-shaped rock about half a mile away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Let’s go and see, your Majesty,” suggested the
Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>This seemed to be the only thing to do, so they all
set out through the sand, which was most uncomfortable
for walking in. On drawing nearer to it, they could see
that the curiously-shaped rock was really a Sphinx carved
out of stone. To Girlie’s great surprise, the Crow,
to whom she had lent her pocket-handkerchief, was
perched up beside it reading a newspaper, stuck up in
front of him.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Well, I never, if it isn’t the Pig,” he said, turning
his head and staring at her through his spectacles, “and
the Wallypug, I do declare. Why, I’ve just been reading
about you both in <i>The Daily Whyer</i>; look here,” and he
held out the paper for them to see.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p162.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“PERCHED UP BESIDE IT READING A NEWSPAPER.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Girlie took it from him and read in large letters,
“Mysterious disappearance of the Wallypug and the
Human Noun, last seen making mud pies on the sea shore.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“We weren’t!” cried Girlie indignantly. “It was a
sand castle we were building.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Well, it’s a very interesting account, anyhow,” replied
the Crow; “and you can’t expect newspaper accounts
always to be <i>quite</i> correct, you know, can you? I was
just reading it aloud to the Sphinx.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What was the use of that?” asked Girlie; “it can’t
hear you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! can’t it, though,” said the Crow; “that’s all <i>you</i>
know about it. It can hear better than you can, I’ll be
bound; can’t you, old chap?” he said, speaking to the Sphinx.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Sphinx did not reply, of course, but it seemed to
Girlie that it <i>smiled</i> in a very knowing way.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It doesn’t say much but it thinks a good deal, I can
tell you,” the Crow went on. “It hasn’t lived all these
four thousand years for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good gracious! is it so old as that?” cried Girlie,
while the others stared at it in amazement, the Bathing-machine
Woman exclaiming with surprise,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Law! bless me, who’d have thought it, now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Has it lived <i>here</i> all that time?” asked the Ancient
Mariner after a pause.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” replied the Crow, “of course; what a stupid
question.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t believe it, then,” said the Ancient Mariner
defiantly. “What has it lived on?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Sandwiches,” replied the Crow; “it’s the only thing
you can get here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sandwiches!” exclaimed Girlie, looking about; “why
whatever do they make them of?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sand, of course,” said the Crow contemptuously.
“Any donkey knows that; that’s why they are called
<i>sand</i>wiches.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“O’ugh! how horrid!” said Girlie. “I should think
they must be very nasty.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve had occasion before to remark that you are very
peculiar in your tastes,” said the Crow sarcastically.
“They’ve been having a rare lark at Why since you’ve
been away,” he continued, addressing himself to the
Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What have they been doing, your Majesty?” asked
the Wallypug anxiously.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, you’re supposed to be dead, to begin with,”
replied the Crow, “and the Cockatoo has headed a Revolution,
and has got herself proclaimed Protectress, and oh!
there’s rare goings on, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh dear! oh dear! I <i>do</i> wish I could get back. I
know what that old Cockatoo is,” said the poor Wallypug
anxiously; “she will upset everything and everybody.
Can’t you suggest something, your Majesty?” he cried,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>turning to Girlie; but Girlie did not know <i>what</i> to
advise.</p>

<p class='c014'>While they had been talking, the Bathing-machine
Woman and the Ancient Mariner had gone a little way
off on an exploring expedition on their own account (the
Bathing-machine Woman having first made a comfortable
bed with her shawl for the baby, between the feet of
the Sphinx, where it lay sleeping peacefully, with its
little thumb stuck in its mouth). Girlie could see them
in the distance, and presently the Ancient Mariner shouted
and beckoned to them excitedly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id014'>
<img src='images/p166.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘WHAT’S THAT?’ HE ASKED, POINTING IN THE AIR.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“What’s that?” he asked, pointing in the air when
they hurried up to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>They could just discern a little black speck ever and ever
so far away.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose it couldn’t be a plum pudding, could it, your
Majesty?” suggested the Wallypug meekly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nonsense,” cried Girlie, “whoever heard of a plum
pudding sailing about in the air. No! it’s a balloon,” she
decided, after looking at it for some time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And so it was. They watched it grow larger and
larger as it drifted towards them, and, at last, they could
just distinguish some one in the car.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Crow said he would fly up and see who it was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and presently returned, saying, “It’s all right, it’s the
Royal Microscopist come to look for you; I told him that
you were here, and he is coming down at once to pick
you up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bathing-machine Woman screamed and said she “was
sure she could never go up in one of those nasty, horrid
things;” but Girlie thought that she should rather like it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meanwhile the balloon was descending rapidly, and they
could soon distinguish the Royal Microscopist looking over
the side of the car.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here you are, then,” he called out cheerfully; “how are
you all?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Very well indeed, thank you,” shouted Girlie, who was
very glad to see him.</p>

<p class='c014'>They had some difficulty in securing the balloon, but,
at last, they succeeded in catching the anchor under a
great rock partly buried in the sand, and the Royal Microscopist
quickly threw out a rope ladder and descended to
the ground.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/p168.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THE CROW SAID HE WOULD FLY UP AND SEE WHO IT WAS.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>After kindly shaking hands with everybody, he turned
to the Wallypug and said, “Things are really reaching
such a pitch at Why, that I couldn’t stand it any longer,
so set out to try to find you. Everything is completely
topsyturvy. The Cockatoo, who has had herself proclaimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Protectress, has established herself in the Royal Palace,
and has turned out your two sisters, who have had to
go to the Crocodile’s to lodge. She has made the Doctor-in-law
Chancellor of the Exchequer with full powers to
make what taxes he likes, so long as he gives her half,
so he simply taxes us for <i>everything</i>. It costs three half-pence
to sneeze at Why now, a halfpenny to sit down and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>a penny to stand up, fourpence halfpenny a day to talk
out loud, and twopence three farthings to whisper, and I’m
really afraid that we shall have to pay for breathing, next.
The Husher has been imprisoned for calling the Cockatoo
names, and all the King’s Minstrel’s compositions have
been publicly burned, and he has been fined forty-six
pounds seven shillings and ninepence three farthings ‘for
writing rubbish’; so that, altogether, things are in a
very uncomfortable state.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I can’t think,” said Girlie, who had been listening in
great surprise, “how all this could have possibly happened
in so short a time; why, it was only this morning that we
started for the Excursion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, you know how queerly time goes at Why,” replied
the Royal Microscopist. “We’ve had a whole month there
since you’ve been away.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s the date there now, your Majesty?” asked the
Wallypug.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“The onety-twoth of Octobruary, I think; isn’t it,
Crow?” said the Royal Microscopist.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My paper is dated the twoty-threeth of Januember,”
replied the Crow, “but, since weekly papers never <i>do</i> come
out on the day that they are dated, you are as likely to
be right as I am.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Well, anyhow, we’d better get back as quickly as
possible, your Majesties, hadn’t we?” asked the poor
Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I suppose you are <i>all</i> coming back?” said the Royal
Microscopist, looking around at the little group inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Bathing-machine Woman and the Ancient Mariner
don’t belong to Why,” explained the Wallypug, “but we
can drop them out on our way.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Bathing-machine Woman screamed again and the
Ancient Mariner looked greatly alarmed, too, till the
Wallypug assured them that he did not mean to drop them
out of the balloon, but only to set them down at their own
homes when they reached them.</p>

<p class='c014'>So the Bathing-machine Woman went to fetch her baby,
which was still lying between the feet of the Sphinx. She
came running back a minute or two afterwards, screaming
violently.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take the child,” she cried breathlessly, bundling it into
the Royal Microscopist’s arms, and immediately falling back
against the Wallypug in a fainting fit.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good gracious! whatever is the matter with her?” said
he, struggling under her weight, while the Ancient Mariner
ran to his assistance.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“She’s fainted, I expect,” said the Wallypug, panting.
“I wonder what we’d better do.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Somebody suggested putting a key down her back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t think that would do any good,” said the Royal
Microscopist. “Give her some of this;” and he took a
small flask of sherry and water from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c014'>They poured a little between her lips, and she soon
opened her eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s the matter?” asked the Royal Microscopist.
“What frightened you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s that old Sphinx,” said the Bathing-machine Woman,
faintly; “it <i>winked</i> at me.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What!” they all cried in surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It winked at me,” persisted the Bathing-machine
Woman. “I had just fetched my baby and turned round
in my funny little way to say ‘Good-bye, Sphinxy dear,’
when I saw the horrid old thing wink. I’m sure it did,
for I wasn’t quite certain about it at first, but, when I looked
the second time, it winked its other eye. Oh dear, oh dear!
I was never so frightened in all my life before; I do believe
the thing is alive.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This all sounded very mysterious, so, as soon as the
Bathing-machine Woman had sufficiently recovered, they
walked over to the Sphinx and had a good look at it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>It sat quite still, however, staring straight in front of
it with that very knowing expression on its face that Girlie
had noticed before.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It must have been her imagination, I expect,” said the
Royal Microscopist, while the Crow chuckled as though he
knew more about it than he cared to say.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well now, let’s be off, your Majesties,” said the Wallypug,
who was in a hurry to start; but there arose a serious
difficulty to their doing so, for, when they had all scrambled
into the car of the balloon, it would not rise with all their
weight in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why don’t you go back by sea?” inquired the Crow of
the Ancient Mariner and the Bathing-machine Woman.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I only wish we could,” replied the Ancient Mariner;
“only we have lost our horse.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, he swam ashore soon after you all landed; I saw
him,” said the Crow. “I daresay he is somewhere over by
the cart now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They decided that the best thing to do would be to hunt
for him, and so they all got out of the balloon and went
over to where they had left the cart. They soon found
the old horse quietly grazing on the grass under the trees.
He seemed quite pleased to see his master again and
neighed delightedly when they fastened him into the shafts.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The sea had become quite calm once more, and Girlie
almost wished that she was going back with them in the
cart, which they watched floating away on the water, the
Bathing-machine Woman waving her handkerchief till they
were out of sight. The Royal Microscopist, the Wallypug
and Girlie then hurried back to the balloon and, climbing up
into the car, they succeeded in getting the anchor loose, and
were soon rising rapidly up into the air, the Crow perching
in the ropes over their heads.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_77 c013'>“OH! this is lovely!” cried Girlie, as the
Balloon rose higher and higher, till the
island with the solitary Sphinx on it
looked a mere speck in the sea below
them. “Will it take us long to get
home?” she asked, after they had been
floating along for some time.</p>
<p class='c014'>“Oh no, not long,” replied the Royal Microscopist.
“What shall we do to pass away the time?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I know a little love story about a pig that I can repeat,
if you wish,” suggested Girlie. “It’s called ‘Piggie’s
Courtship.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug and the Royal Microscopist both
said that they should very much like to hear it,
and the Crow laughed and said, “Oh, if it’s about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>a <i>Pig</i>, I daresay you will repeat it very
nicely.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you mean?” asked Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, ‘birds of a feather flock together,’ and the same
remark applies to pigs, I suppose,” he said, chuckling to
himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Girlie wisely did not take the slightest notice of this
rude remark, but stood up and tried to curtsey, as she
had been taught to do before beginning a recitation;
curtseying in a balloon, though, <i>while it is going up</i>, is a
most difficult thing to do, and poor Girlie did not
succeed very well in her attempt, for she first stumbled
forward into the Wallypug’s arms and then, trying to recover
her balance, she fell back and sat plump into the
Royal Microscopist’s lap.</p>

<p class='c014'>They all had a good laugh at her misfortunes, and
then Girlie smilingly said that she thought that, under
the circumstances, perhaps, she had better sit down to
recite, and the others agreeing with her, she sat with
one hand holding the side of the car and the other
one resting in her lap while she repeated the following
story which, as she explained, a young friend had recited
at their last School Entertainment just before the
Holidays:—</p>

<p class='c014'>“That’s a <i>very</i> old-fashioned kind of love story; they
don’t write them like that at all, nowadays. This is how
a modern love story goes”—and he took off his spectacles
and held them in one claw while reciting the following
verses:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“A MODERN LOVE STORY.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The Lady Betsy Mary Jayne
 Was very tall and somewhat plain.
  (<i>Indeed, does anybody doubt it?</i>)
 Sir Robert Richard Peter Prim
 Was also tall and rather slim
  (<i>Well, please don’t make a fuss about it</i>).</p>

<p class='c015'>“They met each other quite by chance
 While touring in the South of France.
  (<i>Pray, why repeat such idle chatter?</i>)
 She said she really <i>wouldn’t</i> wed;
 It drove the poor man off his head!
  (<i>Oh! did it? Well, it doesn’t matter.</i>)</p>

<p class='c015'>“They met again, ’twas at a ball,
 And so got married after all.
  (<i>Don’t bother! No one cares a jot!</i>)
 She turned out cross and rather ‘snappy,’
 So even <i>now</i> they are not happy!
  (<i>Oh, aren’t they? Who cares if they’re not?</i>)”</p>
<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Well, I’m sure I like the way mine ends much the best,”
said Girlie, when he had finished.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hear, hear!” said the Royal Microscopist, “so do I,
my dear. I like the old-fashioned stories best, too; those
that end with a smile and leave you feeling all the better
and happier for having read them, and not all this new-fangled
rubbish that ends up with a sneer and makes you
feel miserable. What do <i>you</i> say, Wallypug?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh,” said the Wallypug, who seemed to be anxious to
please everybody, “I thought them both very pretty. But
isn’t that Why that I can see over there?” he said, pointing
down to where the tops of some large buildings were just
visible amongst the trees a long way below them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I believe it is,” said the Royal Microscopist, turning
a tap and letting some gas escape so that the balloon
began to descend rapidly.</p>

<p class='c014'>They could soon see that the Wallypug was right, for
presently, they recognised the Royal Palace and the Public
Hall.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah! I shall be very glad to get back again,” said the
Wallypug wistfully. “I am beginning to get very anxious
about my people. How very quiet everything seems,” he
went on as they floated over the town. And indeed the
streets seemed to be quite deserted, and there was no one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>at all in sight, not even in the Market Place in front of the
Public Hall.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I hope nothing serious has happened,” thought Girlie;
for this mysterious silence frightened her, and she was very
glad when the balloon slowly settled down in the gardens
of the Royal Palace and they all got out.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug walked quickly towards the Palace, looking
very serious, and the others followed him in silence. On
nearing the building they could hear voices raised in angry
dispute, and, hurrying to the Dining Hall, whence the sounds
proceeded, they threw the door open and beheld an extraordinary
sight.</p>

<p class='c014'>The room was in the utmost confusion, the remains of a
feast occupying one end of the long table, while the rest of
it was piled high with little bags of silver and gold. The
Doctor-in-law and the Cockatoo sat at the table, the Doctor-in-law
with a very red face and the Cockatoo looking very
angry; they had evidently been quarrelling violently.
They both looked up in surprise when they heard the door
open, and the Cockatoo screamed as the Wallypug, followed
by Girlie and the Royal Microscopist, entered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What does all this mean?” said the Wallypug in a
stern voice and with a quiet dignity which seemed to come
to him all at once.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>The Cockatoo shrank back into her chair and the Doctor-in-law
hung his head and seemed to be stricken dumb.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where are all my people?” demanded the Wallypug in
a firm voice. “Answer me!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id020'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘OH, PRAY FORGIVE US,’ CRIED THE DOCTOR-IN-LAW THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>“In bed!” said the Doctor-in-law faintly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In bed!” cried the Wallypug. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh! pray forgive us!” cried the Doctor-in-law, throwing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>himself on his knees, while the Cockatoo hid her face in one
claw and rocked herself to and fro, saying over and over
again, “What <i>shall</i> we do? What <i>shall</i> we do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Get up at once!” said the Wallypug, “and tell me what
you mean. Why are the People in bed?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Because of the Taxes,” groaned the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you mean? Explain yourself!” demanded the
Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We taxed them one and ninepence three farthings a day
for getting up!” faltered the Doctor-in-law, “and, now
that the other taxes are so heavy, nobody has any money
left, and so they are obliged to stop in bed.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug looked very angry. “Where is the Town
Crier?” he asked at length.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In prison,” answered the Doctor-in-law, turning pale.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What for, pray?” cried the Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Taxes,” moaned the Doctor-in-law.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug frowned and, walking over to the other side
of the room, pulled the bell rope violently.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Cockatoo began to sob and the Doctor-in-law threw
himself down on his knees again.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Servants have all gone away,” he said tremblingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Gone away! Where to?” cried the Wallypug in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Prison,” said the Doctor-in-law, beginning to sob.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you mean to tell me,” said the Wallypug indignantly,
“that they have gone to prison for taxes, too?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” faltered the Doctor-in-law. “You may as well
know, at once, that <i>everybody</i>, except the Cockatoo and
myself, is either in prison or in bed because no one has
any more money left to pay taxes with.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug stamped his foot impatiently. “Go and
bring the Town Crier to me <i>at once</i>,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>And the Doctor-in-law got up from his knees and hurried
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Shall I go, too?” asked the Cockatoo meekly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Stop where you are!” shouted the Wallypug. “Well,
this is a pretty state of affairs,” he continued, addressing
himself to Girlie and the Royal Microscopist. “I wonder
what <i>would</i> have happened, if we had not returned when we
did. Oh! here comes the Town Crier!” he exclaimed a
few minutes later, when the Doctor-in-law and he entered
the room both panting heavily and looking as though they
had been running very quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go at once and proclaim that I have returned, that all
the taxes are abolished, that there will be a meeting in
the Public Hall at five o’clock, and that all the People of
Why are expected to attend it,” said the Wallypug.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>The Town Crier bowed respectfully. “Certainly, sir,” he
said, “And I should like to say, sir, that I am very glad
to see you back. We have been getting on very badly
without you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thank you,” said the Wallypug quietly. “Now go and
issue the Proclamation. As for you two,” he cried, turning
to the Doctor-in-law and the Cockatoo, who were trembling
violently, “you shall be locked up in separate rooms till the
Public Meeting is over and I know what is to be done to
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>After locking them up, the Wallypug sent for a list of
all the people who had been imprisoned for not paying their
taxes. Girlie was greatly surprised to see that the King’s
Minstrel’s name appeared amongst the rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why, he told me that he was enormously rich!” she
said to the Royal Microscopist, when the Wallypug had
gone out of the room to sign the pardons.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nonsense! he was always as poor as a church mouse!”
declared the Royal Microscopist. “He would tell you
<i>anything</i>, if he thought that you would believe it. His
statements, my dear, are like walnuts; they are improved
very greatly by being taken with a grain of salt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then he isn’t engaged to the Wallypug’s niece, either,
I suppose?” said Girlie.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Why, the Wallypug never had a niece, my dear, so
I don’t see how that could be!” laughed the Royal
Microscopist. “He only says things of that sort to try to
appear grand, but I should think that his pride has had a
fall this time, anyhow!”</p>

<p class='c014'>And it turned out afterwards that the King’s Minstrel
had really been so much upset at the overthrow of all
his grand boastings that as soon as he was released he
had left the country in disgust, missed by a very few
and regretted by none.</p>

<p class='c014'>After they had enjoyed some refreshments (which the
Royal Servants prepared for them as soon as they had
been liberated from prison) it was time for them to go
to the Public Meeting, and, when the Wallypug, followed
by Girlie and the Royal Microscopist, entered the Hall by
the door near the throne, the entire company rose to their
feet and cheered over and over again.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Wallypug looked highly pleased at this reception,
and bowed repeatedly and then, motioning Girlie to a seat
which had been placed for her on the dais beside him,
he ascended the throne amidst more cheering.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the confusion had somewhat subsided and the
people had resumed their seats, Girlie could see that all
of her old friends were present, including the Fish (who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>seemed somewhat better) the Calf, the Seals, and the
Crocodile. Madame Penguin smiled pleasantly at her from
her old seat near the door, and even the Porter and the
Station-master were there.</p>

<p class='c014'>They had a prolonged meeting, and it was eventually
decided that the Wallypug was to be for ever excused
from addressing his subjects as “Your Majesty,” and that
he was to have entire control of his own property and
personal affairs, while the people were still to make their
own laws and govern themselves. The money which had
been wrongfully collected for taxes was all to be restored,
and the Doctor-in-law and the Cockatoo were to be punished
by not being allowed to attend any of the Public Meetings
in future, nor to have any voice whatever in the affairs of
the Nation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Before the meeting was over, the Husher formally asked
the Wallypug for his permission to propose to one of
his sisters, and caused some little amusement by not being
able to remember which one it was that he was in love
with. He at last decided, however, that it must be Belinda.
The Wallypug willingly gave his consent, and the meeting
then dispersed, and Girlie followed the Wallypug into the
Palace again, the Royal Microscopist and the Husher being
invited to join them.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>They found Belinda and Lucinda waiting for them in
the Amber Drawing-room, they having returned from the
Crocodile’s, where they had been lodging. They seemed
greatly pleased to see the Wallypug again, and were most
gracious to Girlie, calling her “dear” and making quite
a fuss of her.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Royal Microscopist seemed to be very particular
in his attentions to Lucinda, and Girlie thought that she
should not be at all surprised if they made a match of
it, too. At Belinda’s request, she followed the sisters
upstairs, when they went to dress for dinner, and, while
they were walking along the corridor, Lucinda pointed
out to her a door with the words “Girlie’s Room,” written
over it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pushing it open, she walked through, when the door
immediately closed again and Girlie found herself, to her
great surprise—where <i>do</i> you think? I am sure you will
never guess.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c014'>Why, in her own little play-room at home. The door
by which she had entered had entirely disappeared and
Ellen was just entering by the usual door with the teatray.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“Why, Miss Girlie,” she said when she came in, “how
quiet you have been all the afternoon. You must have
been fast asleep.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m sure I haven’t!” cried Girlie indignantly, rubbing
her eyes, though, and staring about her rather
confusedly. “I’ve been having the most lovely adventure!”</p>

<p class='c014'>To be sure Dumpsey Deazil was still lying on the
domino box and, on looking more closely at Boy’s
letter, which Girlie found herself holding in her hand,
she saw that the word she had taken to be “Goo”
was really “Good,” the <i>d</i> being on the next page, Boy
not being at all particular as to how he divided his
words; the whole sentence read—“I have found a good
many shells.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, Girlie was only half convinced, for were
not the fishes in her little Aquarium all apparently
saying O-o-o-b, o-o-o-b, just as the Fish with a cold
had done, and, outside in the park, could she not
see several Crows stalking about under the trees
looking as though they <i>might</i> be searching for the
Goo which they hoped would turn out to be a large
worm?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Had she been asleep or not?” that was the question;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>she couldn’t decide at all, but, after a little while, she
went up to Ellen, who was arranging the tea-table, and
said,—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ellen, I’m very sorry that I contradicted you so rudely
just now, for—for perhaps I <i>may</i> have been to sleep after
all, you know.”</p>
